was the famous \n","belladonna took, one of the three remarkable \n","daughters of the old took, head of the hobbits \n","who lived across the water, the small river that \n","ran at the foot of the hill. it was often said (in \n","other families) that long ago one of the took \n","ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. that \n","was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was \n","still something not entirely hobbitlike about \n","them, and once in a while members of the \n","took-clan would go and have adventures. they \n","discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it \n","up; but the fact remained that the tooks were \n","not as respectable as the bagginses, though \n","they were undoubtedly richer. \n","\n","\n","\n","not that belladonna took ever had any \n","adventures after she became mrs. bungo \n","baggins. bungo, that was bilbo's father, built \n","the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly \n","with her money) that was to be found either \n","under the hill or over the hill or across the \n","water, and there they remained to the end of \n","their days. still it is probable that bilbo, her only \n","son, although he looked and behaved exactly \n","like a second edition of his solid and \n","comfortable father, got something a bit queer in \n","his make-up from the took side, something that \n","only waited for a chance to come out. the \n","chance never arrived, until bilbo baggins was \n","grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and \n","living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his \n","father, which i have just described for you, until \n","he had in fact apparently settled down \n","immovably. \n","\n","by some curious chance one morning long \n","ago in the quiet of the world, when there was \n","less noise and more green, and the hobbits \n","were still numerous and prosperous, and bilbo \n","baggins was standing at his door after \n","breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden \n","pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes \n","(neatly brushed) - gandalf came by. gandalf! if \n","you had heard only a quarter of what i have \n","heard about him, and i have only heard very little \n","\n","\n","\n","of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for \n","any sort of remarkable tale. tales and \n","adventures sprouted up all over the place \n","wherever he went, in the most extraordinary \n","fashion. he had not been down that way under \n","the hill for ages and ages, not since his friend \n","the old took died, in fact, and the hobbits had \n","almost forgotten what he looked like. he had \n","been away over the hill and across the water \n","on businesses of his own since they were all \n","small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls. \n","\n","all that the unsuspecting bilbo saw that \n","morning was an old man with a staff. he had a \n","tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver \n","scarf over which his long white beard hung \n","down below his waist, and immense black \n","boots. \n","\n","\"good morning!\" said bilbo, and he meant \n","it. the sun was shining, and the grass was very \n","green. but gandalf looked at him from under \n","long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than \n","the brim of his shady hat. \n","\n","\"what do you mean?\" he said. \"do you wish \n","me a good morning, or mean that it is a good \n","morning whether i want it or not; or that you feel \n","good this morning; or that it is a morning to be \n","good on?\" \n","\n","\"all of them at once,\" said bilbo. \"and a very \n","fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, \n","\n","\n","\n","into the bargain. if you have a pipe about you, \n","sit down and have a fill of mine! there's no \n","hurry, we have all the day before us!\" then bilbo \n","sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his \n","legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of \n","smoke that sailed up into the air without \n","breaking and floated away over the hill. \n","\n","\"very pretty!\" said gandalf. \"but i have no \n","time to blow smoke-rings this morning. i am \n","looking for someone to share in an adventure \n","that i am arranging, and it's very difficult to find \n","anyone.\" \n","\n","\"i should think so - in these parts! we are \n","plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. \n","nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! make \n","you late for dinner! i can't think what anybody \n","sees in them,\" said our mr. baggins, and stuck \n","one thumb behind his braces, and blew out \n","another even bigger smoke-ring. then he took \n","out his morning letters, and began to read, \n","pretending to take no more notice of the old \n","man. he had decided that he was not quite his \n","sort, and wanted him to go away. but the old \n","man did not move. he stood leaning on his \n","stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying \n","anything, till bilbo got quite uncomfortable and \n","even a little cross. \n","\n","\"good morning!\" he said at last. \"we don't \n","want any adventures here, thank you! you might \n","\n","\n","\n","try over the hill or across the water.\" by this \n","he meant that the conversation was at an end. \n","\n","\"what a lot of things you do use good \n","morning for!\" said gandalf. \"now you mean that \n","you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be \n","good till i move off.\" \n","\n","\"not at all, not at all, my dear sir! let me \n","see, i don't think i know your name?\" \n","\n","\"yes, yes, my dear sir - and i do know your \n","name, mr. bilbo baggins. and you do know my \n","name, though you don't remember that i belong \n","to it. i am gandalf, and gandalf means me! to \n","think that i should have lived to be good- \n","morninged by belladonna took's son, as if i \n","was selling buttons at the door!\" \n","\n","\"gandalf, gandalf! good gracious me! not \n","the wandering wizard that gave old took a pair \n","of magic diamond studs that fastened \n","themselves and never came undone till \n","ordered? not the fellow who used to tell such \n","wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and \n","goblins and giants and the rescue of \n","princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' \n","sons? not the man that used to make such \n","particularly excellent fireworks! i remember \n","those! old took used to have them on \n","midsummer's eve. splendid! they used to go \n","up like great lilies and snapdragons and \n","laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all \n","\n","\n","\n","evening!\" you will notice already that mr. \n","baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to \n","believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. \n","''dear me!\" he went on. \"not the gandalf who \n","was responsible for so many quiet lads and \n","lasses going off into the blue for mad \n","adventures? anything from climbing trees to \n","visiting elves - or sailing in ships, sailing to \n","other shores! bless me, life used to be quite \n","inter - i mean, you used to upset things badly in \n","these parts once upon a time. i beg your \n","pardon, but i had no idea you were still in \n","business.\" \n","\n","\"where else should i be?\" said the wizard. \n","\"all the same i am pleased to find you \n","remember something about me. you seem to \n","remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and \n","that is not without hope. indeed for your old \n","grandfather look's sake, and for the sake of \n","poor belladonna, i will give you what you asked \n","for.\" \n","\n","\"i beg your pardon, i haven't asked for \n","anything!\" \n","\n","\"yes, you have! twice now. my pardon. i \n","give it you. in fact i will go so far as to send you \n","on this adventure. very amusing for me, very \n","good for you - and profitable too, very likely, if \n","you ever get over it.\" \n","\n","\"sorry! i don't want any adventures, thank \n","\n","\n","you. not today. good morning! but please \n","come to tea - any time you like! why not \n","tomorrow? come tomorrow! good bye!\" with \n","that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his \n","round green door, and shut it as quickly as he \n","dared, not to seem rude. wizards after all are \n","wizards. \n","\n","\"what on earth did i ask him to tea for!\" he \n","said to himself, as he went to the pantry. he had \n","only just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or \n","two and a drink of something would do him \n","good after his fright. \n","\n","gandalf in the meantime was still standing \n","outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. \n","after a while he stepped up, and with the spike \n","on his staff scratched a queer sign on the \n","hobbit's beautiful green front-door. then he \n","strode away, just about the time when bilbo \n","was finishing his second cake and beginning to \n","think that he had escaped adventures very well. \n","\n","the next day he had almost forgotten about \n","gandalf. he did not remember things very well, \n","unless he put them down on his engagement \n","tablet: like this: gandalf tea wednesday. \n","yesterday he had been too flustered to do \n","anything of the kind. \n","\n","just before tea-time there came a \n","tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then \n","he remembered! he rushed and put on the \n","\n","\n","\n","kettle, and put out another cup and saucer, and \n","an extra cake or two, and ran to the door. \n","\n","\"i am so sorry to keep you waiting!\" he was \n","going to say, when he saw that it was not \n","gandalf at all. it was a dwarf with a blue beard \n","tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes \n","under his dark-green hood. as soon as the \n","door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if \n","he had been expected. \n","\n","he hung his hooded cloak on the nearest \n","peg, and \"dwalin at your service!\" he said with \n","a low bow. \n","\n","\"bilbo baggins at yours!\" said the hobbit, \n","too surprised to ask any questions for the \n","moment. when the silence that followed had \n","become uncomfortable, he added: \"i am just \n","about to take tea; pray come and have some \n","with me.\" a little stiff perhaps, but he meant it \n","kindly. and what would you do, if an uninvited \n","dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall \n","without a word of explanation? \n","\n","they had not been at table long, in fact they \n","had hardly reached the third cake, when there \n","came another even louder ring at the bell. \n","\n","\"excuse me!\" said the hobbit, and off he \n","went to the door. \n","\n","\"so you have got here at last!\" that was \n","what he was going to say to gandalf this time. \n","but it was not gandalf. instead there was a very \n","\n","\n","\n","old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard \n","and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside \n","as soon as the door was open, just as if he had \n","been invited. \n","\n","\"i see they have begun to arrive already,\" he \n","said when he caught sight of dwalin's green \n","hood hanging up. he hung his red one next to it, \n","and \"balin at your service!\" he said with his \n","hand on his breast. \n","\n","\"thank you!\" said bilbo with a gasp. it was \n","not the correct thing to say, but they have \n","begun to arrive had flustered him badly. he \n","liked visitors, but he liked to know them before \n","they arrived, and he preferred to ask them \n","himself. he had a horrible thought that the \n","cakes might run short, and then he - as the \n","host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however \n","painful - he might have to go without. \n","\n","\"come along in, and have some tea!\" he \n","managed to say after taking a deep breath. \n","\n","\"a little beer would suit me better, if it is all \n","the same to you, my good sir,\" said balin with \n","the white beard. \"but i don't mind some cake - \n","seed-cake, if you have any.\" \n","\n","\"lots!\" bilbo found himself answering, to his \n","own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, \n","too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then \n","to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed- \n","\n","\n","\n","cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his \n","after-supper morsel. \n","\n","when he got back balin and dwalin were \n","talking at the table like old friends (as a matter \n","of fact they were brothers). bilbo plumped down \n","the beer and the cake in front of them, when \n","loud came a ring at the bell again, and then \n","another ring. \n","\n","\"gandalf for certain this time,\" he thought as \n","he puffed along the passage. but it was not. it \n","was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, \n","silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of \n","them carried a bag of tools and a spade. in they \n","hopped, as soon as the door began to open - \n","bilbo was hardly surprised at all. \n","\n","\"what can i do for you, my dwarves?\" he \n","said. \n","\n","\"kili at your service!\" said the one. \"and \n","fili!\" added the other; and they both swept off \n","their blue hoods and bowed. \n","\n","\"at yours and your family's!\" replied bilbo, \n","remembering his manners this time. \n","\n","\"dwalin and balin here already, i see,\" said \n","kili. \"let us join the throng!\" \n","\n","\"throng!\" thought mr. baggins. \"i don't like \n","the sound of that. i really must sit down for a \n","minute and collect my wits, and have a drink.\" \n","he had only just had a sip - in the corner, while \n","the four dwarves sat round the table, and talked \n","\n","\n","\n","about mines and gold and troubles with the \n","goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and \n","lots of other things which he did not understand, \n","and did not want to, for they sounded much too \n","adventurous - when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang, \n","his bell rang again, as if some naughty little \n","hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. \n","\n","\"someone at the door!\" he said, blinking. \n","\n","\"some four, i should say by the sound,\" said \n","fili. \"besides, we saw them coming along \n","behind us in the distance.\" \n","\n","the poor little hobbit sat down in the hall \n","and put his head in his hands, and wondered \n","what had happened, and what was going to \n","happen, and whether they would all stay to \n","supper. then the bell rang again louder than \n","ever, and he had to run to the door. it was not \n","four after all, it was five. another dwarf had \n","come along while he was wondering in the hall. \n","he had hardly turned the knob, before they were \n","all inside, bowing and saying \"at your service\" \n","one after another. dori, nori, ori, oin, and gloin \n","were their names; and very soon two purple \n","hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white \n","hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they \n","marched with their broad hands stuck in their \n","gold and silver belts to join the others. already it \n","had almost become a throng. some called for \n","ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, \n","\n","\n","\n","and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was \n","kept very busy for a while. \n","\n","a big jug of coffee had just been set in the \n","hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the \n","dwarves were starting on a round of buttered \n","scones, when there came - a loud knock. not a \n","ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful \n","green door. somebody was banging with a \n","stick! \n","\n","bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, \n","and altogether bewildered and bewuthered - \n","this was the most awkward wednesday he ever \n","remembered. he pulled open the door with a \n","jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. \n","more dwarves, four more! and there was \n","gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and \n","laughing. he had made quite a dent on the \n","beautiful door; he had also, by the way, \n","knocked out the secret mark that he had put \n","there the morning before. \n","\n","\"carefully! carefully!\" he said. \"it is not like \n","you, bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, \n","and then open the door like a pop-gun! let me \n","introduce bifur, bofur, bombur, and especially \n","thorin!\" \n","\n","\"at your service!\" said bifur, bofur, and \n","bombur standing in a row. then they hung up \n","two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and \n","also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. \n","\n","\n","\n","this last belonged to thorin, an enormously \n","important dwarf, in fact no other than the great \n","thorin oakenshield himself, who was not at all \n","pleased at falling flat on bilbo's mat with bifur, \n","bofur, and bombur on top of him. for one thing \n","bombur was immensely fat and heavy. thorin \n","indeed was very haughty, and said nothing \n","about service', but poor mr. baggins said he \n","was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted \n","\"pray don't mention it,\" and stopped frowning. \n","\n","\"now we are all here!\" said gandalf, looking \n","at the row of thirteen hoods - the best \n","detachable party hoods - and his own hat \n","hanging on the pegs. \"quite a merry gathering! i \n","hope there is something left for the late-comers \n","to eat and drink! what's that? tea! no thank \n","you! a little red wine, i think for me.\" \n","\n","\"and for me,\" said thorin. \n","\n","\"and raspberry jam and apple-tart,\" said \n","bifur. \n","\n","\"and mince-pies and cheese,\" said bofur. \n","\n","\"and pork-pie and salad,\" said bombur. \n","\n","\"and more cakes - and ale - and coffee, if \n","you don't mind,\" called the other dwarves \n","through the door. \n","\n","\"put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow!\" \n","gandalf called after him, as the hobbit stumped \n","off to the pantries. \"and just bring out the cold \n","chicken and pickles!\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"seems to know as much about the inside \n","of my larders as i do myself!\" thought mr. \n","baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, \n","and was beginning to wonder whether a most \n","wretched adventure had not come right into his \n","house. by the time he had got all the bottles and \n","dishes and knives and forks and glasses and \n","plates and spoons and things piled up on big \n","trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the \n","face, and annoyed. \n","\n","\"confusticate and bebother these \n","dwarves!\" he said aloud. \"why don't they come \n","and lend a hand?\" lo and behold! there stood \n","balin and dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and \n","fili and kili behind them, and before he could \n","say knife they had whisked the trays and a \n","couple of small tables into the parlour and set \n","out everything afresh. \n","\n","gandalf sat at the head of the party with the \n","thirteen dwarves all round: and bilbo sat on a \n","stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his \n","appetite was quite taken away), and trying to \n","look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not \n","in the least an adventure. the dwarves ate and \n","ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. at \n","last they pushed their chairs back, and bilbo \n","made a move to collect the plates and glasses. \n","\n","\"i suppose you will all stay to supper?\" he \n","said in his politest unpressing tones. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"of course!\" said thorin. \"and after. we \n","shan't get through the business till late, and we \n","must have some music first. now to clear up!\" \n","\n","thereupon the twelve dwarves - not thorin, \n","he was too important, and stayed talking to \n","gandalf - jumped to their feet, and made tall \n","piles of all the things. off they went, not waiting \n","for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with \n","a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the \n","hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with \n","fright: \"please be careful!\" and \"please, don't \n","trouble! i can manage.\" but the dwarves only \n","started to sing: \n","\n","\n","chip the glasses and crack the plates! \n","\n","blunt the knives and bend the forks! \n","that's i/i hat bilbo baggins hates- \n","smash the bottles and burn the corks! \n","\n","\n","cut the cloth and tread on the fat! \n","\n","pour the milk on the pantry floor! \n","leave the bones on the bedroom mat! \n","splash the 1/1 ine on every door! \n","\n","\n","\n","dump the crocks in a boiling bow/; \n","\n","pound them up with a thumping pole; \n","and when you've finished, if any are \n","whole, \n","\n","send them down the hall to roll! \n","\n","\n","that's what bilbo baggins hates! \n","\n","so, carefully! carefully with the plates! \n","\n","\n","and of course they did none of these \n","dreadful things, and everything was cleaned \n","and put away safe as quick as lightning, while \n","the hobbit was turning round and round in the \n","middle of the kitchen trying to see what they \n","were doing. then they went back, and found \n","thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a \n","pipe. he was blowing the most enormous \n","smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it \n","went - up the chimney, or behind the clock on \n","the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round \n","and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it \n","was not quick enough to escape gandalf. pop! \n","he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short \n","clay-pipe straight through each one of thorin's. \n","\n","\n","\n","then gandalfs smoke-ring would go green and \n","come back to hover over the wizard's head. he \n","had a cloud of them about him already, and in \n","the dim light it made him look strange and \n","sorcerous. bilbo stood still and watched - he \n","loved smoke-rings - and then he blushed to \n","think how proud he had been yesterday \n","morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up the \n","wind over the hill. \n","\n","\"now for some music!\" said thorin. \"bring \n","out the instruments!\" \n","\n","kili and fili rushed for their bags and \n","brought back little fiddles; dori, nori, and ori \n","brought out flutes from somewhere inside their \n","coats; bombur produced a drum from the hall; \n","bifur and bofur went out too, and came back \n","with clarinets that they had left among the \n","walking-sticks. dwalin and balin said: \"excuse \n","me, i left mine in the porch!\" \"just bring mine in \n","with you!\" said thorin. they came back with \n","viols as big as themselves, and with thorin's \n","harp wrapped in a green cloth. it was a beautiful \n","golden harp, and when thorin struck it the \n","music began all at once, so sudden and sweet \n","that bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept \n","away into dark lands under strange moons, far \n","over the water and very far from his hobbit- \n","hole under the hill. \n","\n","the dark came into the room from the little \n","\n","\n","\n","window that opened in the side of the hill; the \n","firelight flickered - it was april - and still they \n","played on, while the shadow of gandalf s beard \n","wagged against the wall. \n","\n","the dark filled all the room, and the fire died \n","down, and the shadows were lost, and still they \n","played on. and suddenly first one and then \n","another began to sing as they played, deep- \n","throated singing of the dwarves in the deep \n","places of their ancient homes; and this is like a \n","fragment of their song, if it can be like their \n","song without their music. \n","\n","\n","far over the misty mountains cold \n","to dungeons deep and caverns old \n","we must away ere break of day \n","to seek the pale enchanted gold. \n","\n","\n","the dwarves of yore made mighty spells, \n","while hammers fell like ringing bells \n","in places deep, where dark things sleep, \n","in hollowhalls beneath the fells. \n","\n","\n","\n","for ancient king and elvish lord \n","there many a gleaming golden hoard \n","they shaped and wrought, and light they \n","caught \n","\n","to hide in gems on hilt of sward. \n","\n","\n","on silver necklaces they strung \n","\n","the flowering stars, on crowns they hung \n","\n","the dragon-fire, in twisted wire \n","\n","they meshed the light of moon and sun. \n","\n","\n","far over the misty mountains cold \n","to dungeons deep and caverns old \n","we must away, ere break of day, \n","\n","to claim our long-forgotten gold. \n","\n","\n","goblets they carved there for themselves \n","and harps of gold; where no man delves \n","there lay they long, and many a song \n","was sung unheard by men or elves. \n","\n","\n","the pines were roaring on the height, \n","\n","\n","\n","the winds were moaning in the night. \n","the fire ms red, it flaming spread; \n","\n","the trees like torches blazed with light. \n","\n","\n","the bells were ringing in the dale \n","and men looked up with faces pale; \n","the dragon's ire more fierce than fire \n","laid lowtheir towers and houses frail. \n","\n","\n","the mountain smoked beneath the \n","moon; \n","\n","the dmrves, they heard the tramp of \n","doom. \n","\n","they fled their hall to dying fall \n","beneath his feet, beneath the moon. \n","\n","\n","far over the misty mountains grim \n","to dungeons deep and caverns dim \n","we must amy, ere break of day, \n","\n","to win our harps and gold from him! \n","\n","\n","\n","as they sang the hobbit felt the love of \n","beautiful things made by hands and by cunning \n","and by magic moving through him, a fierce and \n","a jealous love, the desire of the hearts of \n","dwarves. then something tookish woke up \n","inside him, and he wished to go and see the \n","great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and \n","the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear \n","a sword instead of a walking-stick. he looked \n","out of the window. the stars were out in a dark \n","sky above the trees. he thought of the jewels of \n","the dwarves shining in dark caverns. suddenly \n","in the wood beyond the water a flame leapt up \n","- probably somebody lighting a wood-fire - \n","and he thought of plundering dragons settling \n","on his quiet hill and kindling it all to flames. he \n","shuddered; and very quickly he was plain mr. \n","baggins of bag-end, under-hill, again. \n","\n","he got up trembling. he had less than half a \n","mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a \n","mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the \n","beer-barrels in the cellar, and not come out \n","again until all the dwarves had gone away. \n","suddenly he found that the music and the \n","singing had stopped, and they were all looking \n","at him with eyes shining in the dark. \n","\n","\"where are you going?\" said thorin, in a \n","tone that seemed to show that he guessed both \n","\n","\n","\n","halves of the hobbit's mind. \n","\n","\"what about a little light?\" said bilbo \n","apologetically. \n","\n","\"we like the dark,\" said all the dwarves. \n","\"dark for dark business! there are many hours \n","before dawn.\" \n","\n","\"of course!\" said bilbo, and sat down in a \n","hurry. he missed the stool and sat in the fender, \n","knocking over the poker and shovel with a \n","crash. \n","\n","\"hush!\" said gandalf. \"let thorin speak!\" \n","and this is how thorin began. \n","\n","\"gandalf, dwarves and mr. baggins! we \n","are met together in the house of our friend and \n","fellow conspirator, this most excellent and \n","audacious hobbit - may the hair on his toes \n","never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale! - \" \n","he paused for breath and for a polite remark \n","from the hobbit, but the compliments were quite \n","lost on poor bilbo baggins, who was wagging \n","his mouth in protest at being called audacious \n","and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no \n","noise came out, he was so flummoxed. so \n","thorin went on: \n","\n","\"we are met to discuss our plans, our ways, \n","means, policy and devices. we shall soon \n","before the break of day start on our long \n","journey, a journey from which some of us, or \n","perhaps all of us (except our friend and \n","\n","\n","\n","counsellor, the ingenious wizard gandalf) may \n","never return. it is a solemn moment. our object \n","is, i take it, well known to us all. to the \n","estimable mr. baggins, and perhaps to one or \n","two of the younger dwarves (i think i should be \n","right in naming kili and fili, for instance), the \n","exact situation at the moment may require a \n","little brief explanation - \" \n","\n","this was thorin's style. he was an \n","important dwarf. if he had been allowed, he \n","would probably have gone on like this until he \n","was out of breath, without telling any one there \n","anything that was not known already. but he \n","was rudely interrupted. poor bilbo couldn't bear \n","it any longer. at may never return he began to \n","feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it \n","burst out like the whistle of an engine coming \n","out of a tunnel. all the dwarves sprang up, \n","knocking over the table. gandalf struck a blue \n","light on the end of his magic staff, and in its \n","firework glare the poor little hobbit could be \n","seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a \n","jelly that was melting. then he fell flat on the \n","floor, and kept on calling out \"struck by lightning, \n","struck by lightning!\" over and over again; and \n","that was all they could get out of him for a long \n","time. so they took him and laid him out of the \n","way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at \n","his elbow, and they went back to their dark \n","\n","\n","\n","business. \n","\n","\"excitable little fellow,\" said gandalf, as they \n","sat down again. \"gets funny queer fits, but he is \n","one of the best, one of the best - as fierce as a \n","dragon in a pinch.\" \n","\n","if you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, \n","you will realize that this was only poetical \n","exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to old \n","took's great-grand-uncle bullroarer, who was \n","so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a \n","horse. he charged the ranks of the goblins of \n","mount gram in the battle of the green fields, \n","and knocked their king golfimbul's head clean \n","off with a wooden club. it sailed a hundred yards \n","through the air and went down a rabbit-hole, \n","and in this way the battle was won and the \n","game of golf invented at the same moment. \n","\n","in the meanwhile, however, bullroarer's \n","gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing- \n","room. after a while and a drink he crept \n","nervously to the door of the parlour. this is what \n","he heard, gloin speaking: \"humph!\" (or some \n","snort more or less like that). \"will he do, do you \n","think? it is all very well for gandalf to talk about \n","this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that \n","in a moment of excitement would be enough to \n","wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill \n","the lot of us. i think it sounded more like fright \n","than excitement! in fact, if it had not been for the \n","\n","\n","\n","sign on the door, i should have been sure we \n","had come to the wrong house. as soon as i \n","clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and \n","puffing on the mat, i had my doubts. he looks \n","more like a grocer than a burglar!\" \n","\n","then mr. baggins turned the handle and \n","went in. the took side had won. he suddenly \n","felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be \n","thought fierce. as for little fellowbobbing on the \n","mat it almost made him really fierce. many a \n","time afterwards the baggins part regretted what \n","he did now, and he said to himself: \"bilbo, you \n","were a fool; you walked right in and put your \n","foot in it.\" \n","\n","\"pardon me,\" he said, \"if i have overheard \n","words that you were saying. i don't pretend to \n","understand what you are talking about, or your \n","reference to burglars, but i think i am right in \n","believing\" (this is what he called being on his \n","dignity) \"that you think i am no good. i will show \n","you. i have no signs on my door - it was painted \n","a week ago - , and i am quite sure you have \n","come to the wrong house. as soon as i saw \n","your funny faces on the door-step, i had my \n","doubts. but treat it as the right one. tell me \n","what you want done, and i will try it, if i have to \n","walk from here to the east of east and fight the \n","wild were-worms in the last desert. i had a \n","\n","\n","\n","great-great-great-grand-uncle once, bullroarer \n","took, and - \" \n","\n","\"yes, yes, but that was long ago,\" said \n","gloin. \"i was talking about you. and i assure you \n","there is a mark on this door - the usual one in \n","the trade, or used to be. burglar wants a good \n","job, plenty of excitement and reasonable \n","reward, that's how it is usually read. you can \n","say expert treasure-hunter instead of burglar \n","if you like. some of them do. it's all the same to \n","us. gandalf told us that there was a man of the \n","sort in these parts looking for a job at once, \n","and that he had arranged for a meeting here \n","this wednesday tea-time.\" \n","\n","\"of course there is a mark,\" said gandalf. \"i \n","put it there myself. for very good reasons. you \n","asked me to find the fourteenth man for your \n","expedition, and i chose mr. baggins. just let \n","any one say i chose the wrong man or the \n","wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and \n","have all the bad luck you like, or go back to \n","digging coal.\" \n","\n","he scowled so angrily at gloin that the \n","dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when bilbo \n","tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he \n","turned and frowned at him and stuck out his \n","bushy eyebrows, till bilbo shut his mouth tight \n","with a snap. \"that's right,\" said gandalf. \"let's \n","\n","\n","\n","have no more argument. i have chosen mr. \n","baggins and that ought to be enough for all of \n","you. if i say he is a burglar, a burglar he is, or \n","will be when the time comes. there is a lot \n","more in him than you guess, and a deal more \n","than he has any idea of himself. you may \n","(possibly) all live to thank me yet. now bilbo, my \n","boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have a little light \n","on this!\" \n","\n","on the table in the light of a big lamp with a \n","red shade he spread a piece of parchment \n","rather like a map. \n","\n","\"this was made by thror, your grandfather, \n","thorin,\" he said in answer to the dwarves' \n","excited questions. \"it is a plan of the mountain.\" \n","\n","\"i don't see that this will help us much,\" said \n","thorin disappointedly after a glance. \"i \n","remember the mountain well enough and the \n","lands about it. and i know where mirkwood is, \n","and the withered heath where the great \n","dragons bred.\" \n","\n","\"there is a dragon marked in red on the \n","mountain,\" said balin, \"but it will be easy \n","enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive \n","there.\" \n","\n","\"there is one point that you haven't \n","noticed,\" said the wizard, \"and that is the secret \n","entrance. you see that rune on the west side, \n","and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? \n","\n","\n","\n","that marks a hidden passage to the lower \n","halls.\" (look at the map at the beginning of this \n","book, and you will see there the runes.) \n","\n","\"it may have been secret once,\" said thorin, \n","\"but how do we know that it is secret any \n","longer? old smaug has lived there long enough \n","now to find out anything there is to know about \n","those caves.\" \n","\n","\"he may - but he can't have used it for \n","years and years.\" \n","\n","\"why?\" \n","\n","\"because it is too small. ' five feet high the \n","door and three may walk abreast ' say the \n","runes, but smaug could not creep into a hole \n","that size, not even when he was a young \n","dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of \n","the dwarves and men of dale.\" \n","\n","\"it seems a great big hole to me,\" squeaked \n","bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and \n","only of hobbit-holes). he was getting excited \n","and interested again, so that he forgot to keep \n","his mouth shut. he loved maps, and in his hall \n","there hung a large one of the country round \n","with all his favourite walks marked on it in red \n","ink. \"how could such a large door be kept \n","secret from everybody outside, apart from the \n","dragon?\" he asked. he was only a little hobbit \n","you must remember. \n","\n","\"in lots of ways,\" said gandalf. \"but in what \n","\n","\n","way this one has been hidden we don't know \n","without going to see. from what it says on the \n","map i should guess there is a closed door \n","which has been made to look exactly like the \n","side of the mountain. that is the usual dwarves' \n","method - i think that is right, isn't it?\" \n","\n","\"quite right,\" said thorin. \n","\n","\"also,\" went on gandalf, \"i forgot to mention \n","that with the map went a key, a small and \n","curious key. here it is!\" he said, and handed to \n","thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate \n","wards, made of silver. \"keep it safe!\" \n","\n","\"indeed i will,\" said thorin, and he fastened \n","it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck \n","and under his jacket. \"now things begin to look \n","more hopeful. this news alters them much for \n","the better. so far we have had no clear idea \n","what to do. we thought of going east, as quiet \n","and careful as we could, as far as the long \n","lake. after that the trouble would begin - .\" \n","\n","\"a long time before that, if i know anything \n","about the roads east,\" interrupted gandalf. \n","\n","\"we might go from there up along the river \n","running,\" went on thorin taking no notice, \"and \n","so to the ruins of dale - the old town in the \n","valley there, under the shadow of the mountain. \n","but we none of us liked the idea of the front \n","gate. the river runs right out of it through the \n","great cliff at the south of the mountain, and out \n","\n","\n","\n","of it comes the dragon too - far too often, \n","unless he has changed his habits.\" \n","\n","\"that would be no good,\" said the wizard, \n","\"not without a mighty warrior, even a hero. i \n","tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting \n","one another in distant lands, and in this \n","neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply \n","not to be found. swords in these parts are \n","mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and \n","shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons \n","are comfortably far-off (and therefore \n","legendary). that is why i settled on burglary- \n","especially when i remembered the existence of \n","a side-door. and here is our little bilbo \n","baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected \n","burglar. so now let's get on and make some \n","plans.\" \n","\n","\"very well then,\" said thorin, \"supposing the \n","burglar-expert gives us some ideas or \n","suggestions.\" he turned with mock-politeness \n","to bilbo. \n","\n","\"first i should like to know a bit more about \n","things,\" said he, feeling all confused and a bit \n","shaky inside, but so far still tookishly \n","determined to go on with things. \"i mean about \n","the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it \n","got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and \n","further.\" \n","\n","\"bless me!\" said thorin, \"haven't you got a \n","\n","\n","\n","map? and didn't you hear our song? and \n","haven't we been talking about all this for \n","hours?\" \n","\n","\"all the same, i should like it all plain and \n","clear,\" said he obstinately, putting on his \n","business manner (usually reserved for people \n","who tried to borrow money off him), and doing \n","his best to appear wise and prudent and \n","professional and live up to gandalfs \n","recommendation. \"also i should like to know \n","about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time \n","required and remuneration, and so forth\" - by \n","which he meant: \"what am i going to get out of \n","it? and am i going to come back alive?\" \n","\n","\"o very well,\" said thorin. \"long ago in my \n","grandfather thror's time our family was driven \n","out of the far north, and came back with all their \n","wealth and their tools to this mountain on the \n","map. it had been discovered by my far \n","ancestor, thrain the old, but now they mined \n","and they tunnelled and they made huger halls \n","and greater workshops - and in addition i \n","believe they found a good deal of gold and a \n","great many jewels too. anyway they grew \n","immensely rich and famous, and my \n","grandfather was king under the mountain \n","again, and treated with great reverence by the \n","mortal men, who lived to the south, and were \n","gradually spreading up the running river as far \n","\n","\n","\n","as the valley overshadowed by the mountain. \n","they built the merry town of dale there in those \n","days. kings used to send for our smiths, and \n","reward even the least skillful most richly. \n","fathers would beg us to take their sons as \n","apprentices, and pay us handsomely, \n","especially in food-supplies, which we never \n","bothered to grow or find for ourselves. \n","altogether those were good days for us, and \n","the poorest of us had money to spend and to \n","lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just \n","for the fun of it, not to speak of the most \n","marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is \n","not to be found in the world now-a-days. so my \n","grandfather's halls became full of armour and \n","jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy \n","market of dale was the wonder of the north. \n","\n","\"undoubtedly that was what brought the \n","dragon. dragons steal gold and jewels, you \n","know, from men and elves and dwarves, \n","wherever they can find them; and they guard \n","their plunder as long as they live (which is \n","practically for ever, unless they are killed), and \n","never enjoy a brass ring of it. indeed they hardly \n","know a good bit of work from a bad, though \n","they usually have a good notion of the current \n","market value; and they can't make a thing for \n","themselves, not even mend a little loose scale \n","of their armour. there were lots of dragons in \n","\n","\n","\n","the north in those days, and gold was probably \n","getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying \n","south or getting killed, and all the general waste \n","and destruction that dragons make going from \n","bad to worse. there was a most specially \n","greedy, strong and wicked worm called smaug. \n","one day he flew up into the air and came south. \n","the first we heard of it was a noise like a \n","hurricane coming from the north, and the pine- \n","trees on the mountain creaking and cracking in \n","the wind. some of the dwarves who happened \n","to be outside (i was one luckily - a fine \n","adventurous lad in those days, always \n","wandering about, and it saved my life that day) \n","- well, from a good way off we saw the dragon \n","settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. then \n","he came down the slopes and when he reached \n","the woods they all went up in fire. by that time \n","all the bells were ringing in dale and the \n","warriors were arming. the dwarves rushed out \n","of their great gate; but there was the dragon \n","waiting for them. none escaped that way. the \n","river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on dale, \n","and in the fog the dragon came on them and \n","destroyed most of the warriors - the usual \n","unhappy story, it was only too common in those \n","days. then he went back and crept in through \n","the front gate and routed out all the halls, and \n","lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and \n","\n","\n","\n","passages. after that there were no dwarves left \n","alive inside, and he took all their wealth for \n","himself. probably, for that is the dragons' way, \n","he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, \n","and sleeps on it for a bed. later he used to \n","crawl out of the great gate and come by night to \n","dale, and carry away people, especially \n","maidens, to eat, until dale was ruined, and all \n","the people dead or gone. what goes on there \n","now i don't know for certain, but i don't suppose \n","any one lives nearer to the mountain than the far \n","edge of the long lake now-a-days. \n","\n","\"the few of us that were well outside sat \n","and wept in hiding, and cursed smaug; and \n","there we were unexpectedly joined by my father \n","and my grandfather with singed beards. they \n","looked very grim but they said very little. when i \n","asked how they had got away, they told me to \n","hold my tongue, and said that one day in the \n","proper time i should know. after that we went \n","away, and we have had to earn our livings as \n","best we could up and down the lands, often \n","enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or \n","even coalmining. but we have never forgotten \n","our stolen treasure. and even now, when i will \n","allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so \n","badly off' - here thorin stroked the gold chain \n","round his neck - \"we still mean to get it back, \n","and to bring our curses home to smaug - if we \n","\n","\n","\n","can. \n","\n","\"i have often wondered about my father's \n","and my grandfather's escape. i see now they \n","must have had a private side-door which only \n","they knew about. but apparently they made a \n","map, and i should like to know how gandalf got \n","hold of it, and why it did not come down to me, \n","the rightful heir.\" \n","\n","\"i did not 'get hold of it,' i was given it,\" said \n","the wizard. \"your grandfather thror was killed, \n","you remember, in the mines of moria by azoa \n","the goblin .\" \n","\n","\"curse his name, yes,\" said thorin. \n","\n","\"and thrain your father went away on the \n","twenty-first of april, a hundred years ago last \n","thursday, and has never been seen by you \n","since - \" \n","\n","\"true, true,\" said thorin. \n","\n","\"well, your father gave me this to give to \n","you; and if i have chosen my own time and way \n","for handing it over, you can hardly blame me, \n","considering the trouble i had to find you. your \n","father could not remember his own name when \n","he gave me the paper, and he never told me \n","yours; so on the whole i think i ought to be \n","praised and thanked! here it is,\" said he \n","handing the map to thorin. \n","\n","\"i don't understand,\" said thorin, and bilbo \n","felt he would have liked to say the same. the \n","\n","\n","explanation did not seem to explain. \n","\n","\"your grandfather,\" said the wizard slowly \n","and grimly, \"gave the map to his son for safety \n","before he went to the mines of moria. your \n","father went away to try his luck with the map \n","after your grandfather was killed; and lots of \n","adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, \n","but he never got near the mountain. how he got \n","there i don't know, but i found him a prisoner in \n","the dungeons of the necromancer.\" \n","\n","\"whatever were you doing there?\" asked \n","thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves \n","shivered. \n","\n","\"never you mind. i was finding things out, as \n","usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. \n","even i, gandalf, only just escaped. i tried to \n","save your father, but it was too late. he was \n","witless and wandering, and had forgotten \n","almost everything except the map and the key.\" \n","\n","\"we have long ago paid the goblins of \n","moria,\" said thorin; \"we must give a thought to \n","the necromancer.\" \n","\n","\"don't be absurd! he is an enemy far \n","beyond the powers of all the dwarves put \n","together, if they could all be collected again \n","from the four corners of the world. the one thing \n","your father wished was for his son to read the \n","map and use the key. the dragon and the \n","mountain are more than big enough tasks for \n","\n","\n","\n","you!\" \n","\n","\"hear, hear!\" said bilbo, and accidentally \n","said it aloud. \n","\n","\"hear what?\" they all said turning suddenly \n","towards him, and he was so flustered that he \n","answered \"hear what i have got to say!\" \n","\n","\"what's that?\" they asked. \n","\n","\"well, i should say that you ought to go east \n","and have a look round. after all there is the \n","side-door, and dragons must sleep \n","sometimes, i suppose. if you sit on the door- \n","step long enough, i daresay you will think of \n","something. and well, don't you know, i think we \n","have talked long enough for one night, if you \n","see what i mean. what about bed, and an early \n","start, and all that? i will give you a good \n","breakfast before you go.\" \n","\n","\"before we go, i suppose you mean,\" said \n","thorin. \"aren't you the burglar? and isn't sitting \n","on the door-step your job, not to speak of \n","getting inside the door? but i agree about bed \n","and breakfast. i like six eggs with my ham, \n","when starting on a journey: fried not poached, \n","and mind you don't break 'em.\" \n","\n","after all the others had ordered their \n","breakfasts without so much as a please (which \n","annoyed bilbo very much), they all got up. the \n","hobbit had to find room for them all, and filled all \n","his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and \n","\n","\n","\n","sofas, before he got them all stowed and went \n","to his own little bed very tired and not altogether \n","happy. one thing he did make his mind up \n","about was not to bother to get up very early and \n","cook everybody else's wretched breakfast. the \n","tookishness was wearing off, and he was not \n","now quite so sure that he was going on any \n","journey in the morning. \n","\n","as he lay in bed he could hear thorin still \n","humming to himself in the best bedroom next to \n","him: \n","\n","\n","far over the misty mountains cold \n","to dungeons deep and caverns old \n","we must away, ere break of day, \n","\n","to find our long-forgotten gold. \n","\n","\n","bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and \n","it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. it was \n","long after the break of day, when he woke up. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter ii \n","\n","\n","roast mutton \n","\n","\n","up jumped bilbo, and putting on his dressing- \n","gown went into the dining-room. there he saw \n","nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried \n","breakfast. there was a fearful mess in the \n","room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the \n","kitchen. nearly every pot and pan he \n","possessed seemed to have been used. the \n","washing-up was so dismally real that bilbo was \n","forced to believe the party of the night before \n","had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had \n","rather hoped. indeed he was really relieved \n","after all to think that they had all gone without \n","him, and without bothering to wake him up (\"but \n","with never a thank-you\" he thought); and yet in a \n","way he could not help feeling just a trifle \n","disappointed. the feeling surprised him. \n","\n","\"don't be a fool. bilbo baggins!\" he said to \n","himself, \"thinking of dragons and all that \n","outlandish nonsense at your age!\" so he put on \n","an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. \n","then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen \n","before turning out the dining-room. by that time \n","the sun was shining; and the front door was \n","open, letting in a warm spring breeze. bilbo \n","began to whistle loudly and to forget about the \n","night before. in fact he was just sitting down to a \n","\n","\n","nice little second breakfast in the dining-room \n","by the open window, when in walked gandalf. \n","\n","\"my dear fellow,\" said he, \"whenever are \n","you going to come? what about an early start? \n","- and here you are having breakfast, or \n","whatever you call it, at half past ten! they left \n","you the message, because they could not wait.\" \n","\n","\"what message?\" said poor mr. baggins all \n","in a fluster. \n","\n","\"great elephants!\" said gandalf, \"you are \n","not at all yourself this morning - you have never \n","dusted the mantelpiece!\" \n","\n","\"what's that got to do with it? i have had \n","enough to do with washing up for fourteen!\" \n","\n","\"if you had dusted the mantelpiece, you \n","would have found this just under the clock,\" said \n","gandalf, handing bilbo a note (written, of \n","course, on his own note-paper). \n","\n","this is what he read: \n","\n","\n","\"thorin and company to burglar bilbo \n","greeting! for your hospitality our sincerest \n","thanks, and for your offer of professional \n","assistance our grateful acceptance. terms: \n","cash on delivery, up to and not exceeding one \n","fourteenth of total profits (if any); all travelling \n","expenses guaranteed in any event; funeral \n","expenses to be defrayed by us or our \n","representatives, if occasion arises and the \n","matter is not otherwise arranged for. \n","\n","\"thinking it unnecessary to disturb your \n","esteemed repose, we have proceeded in \n","advance to make requisite preparations, and \n","shall await your respected person at the green \n","\n","\n","\n","dragon inn, bywater, at 11 a.m. sharp. trusting \n","that you will be punctual, \n","\n","\" we have the honour to remain \n","\" yours deeply \n","\" thorin & co.\" \n","\n","\"that leaves you just ten minutes. you will \n","have to run,\" said gandalf. \n","\n","\"but - ,\" said bilbo. \n","\n","\"no time for it,\" said the wizard. \n","\n","\"but - ,\" said bilbo again. \n","\n","\"no time for that either! off you go!\" \n","\n","to the end of his days bilbo could never \n","remember how he found himself outside, \n","without a hat, a walking-stick or any money, or \n","anything that he usually took when he went out; \n","leaving his second breakfast half-finished and \n","quite unwashed-up, pushing his keys into \n","gandalf s hands, and running as fast as his furry \n","feet could carry him down the lane, past the \n","great mill, across the water, and then on for a \n","mile or more. \n","\n","very puffed he was, when he got to bywater \n","just on the stroke of eleven, and found he had \n","come without a pocket-handkerchief! \n","\n","\"bravo!\" said balin who was standing at the \n","inn door looking out for him. \n","\n","just then all the others came round the \n","corner of the road from the village. they were \n","on ponies, and each pony was slung about with \n","all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and \n","paraphernalia. there was a very small pony, \n","apparently for bilbo. \n","\n","\"up you two get, and off we go!\" said \n","thorin. \n","\n","\"i'm awfully sorry,\" said bilbo, \"but i have \n","\n","\n","\n","come without my hat, and i have left my pocket- \n","handkerchief behind, and i haven't got any \n","money. i didn't get your note until after 10.45 to \n","be precise.\" \n","\n","\"don't be precise,\" said dwalin, \"and don't \n","worry! you will have to manage without pocket- \n","handkerchiefs, and a good many other things, \n","before you get to the journey's end. as for a hat, \n","\n","i have got a spare hood and cloak in my \n","luggage.\" \n","\n","that's how they all came to start, jogging off \n","from the inn one fine morning just before may, \n","on laden ponies; and bilbo was wearing a dark- \n","green hood (a little weather-stained) and a \n","dark-green cloak borrowed from dwalin. they \n","were too large for him, and he looked rather \n","comic. what his father bungo would have \n","thought of him, i daren't think. his only comfort \n","was he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as he \n","had no beard. \n","\n","they had not been riding very long, when up \n","came gandalf very splendid on a white horse. \n","he had brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, \n","and bilbo's pipe and tobacco. so after that the \n","party went along very merrily, and they told \n","stories or sang songs as they rode forward all \n","day, except of course when they stopped for \n","meals. these didn't come quite as often as \n","bilbo would have liked them, but still he began \n","to feel that adventures were not so bad after all. \n","\n","at first they had passed through hobbit- \n","lands, a wide respectable country inhabited by \n","decent folk, with good roads, an inn or two, and \n","now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on \n","business. then they came to lands where \n","\n","\n","\n","people spoke strangely, and sang songs bilbo \n","had never heard before. now they had gone on \n","far into the lone-lands, where there were no \n","people left, no inns, and the roads grew steadily \n","worse. not far ahead were dreary hills, rising \n","higher and higher, dark with trees. on some of \n","them were old castles with an evil look, as if \n","they had been built by wicked people. \n","everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that \n","day had taken a nasty turn. mostly it had been \n","as good as may can be, can be, even in merry \n","tales, but now it was cold and wet. in the lone- \n","lands they had been obliged to camp when they \n","could, but at least it had been dry. \n","\n","\"to think it will soon be june!\" grumbled \n","bilbo, as he splashed along behind the others \n","in a very muddy track. it was after tea-time; it \n","was pouring with rain, and had been all day; his \n","hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was \n","full of water; the pony was tired and stumbled on \n","stones; the others were too grumpy to talk. \"and \n","i'm sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and \n","into the food-bags,\" thought bilbo. \"bother \n","burgling and everything to do with it! i wish i was \n","at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the \n","kettle just beginning to sing!\" it was not the last \n","time that he wished that! \n","\n","still the dwarves jogged on, never turning \n","round or taking any notice of the hobbit. \n","somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun \n","must have gone down, for it began to get dark \n","as they went down into a deep valley with a river \n","at the bottom. wind got up, and willows along \n","its banks bent and sighed. fortunately the road \n","went over an ancient stone bridge, for the river, \n","\n","\n","\n","swollen with the rains, came rushing down from \n","the hills and mountains in the north. \n","\n","it was nearly night when they had crossed \n","over. the wind broke up the grey clouds, and a \n","wandering moon appeared above the hills \n","between the flying rags. then they stopped, and \n","thorin muttered something about supper, \"and \n","where shall we get a dry patch to sleep on?\" \n","\n","not until then did they notice that gandalf \n","was missing. so far he had come all the way \n","with them, never saying if he was in the \n","adventure or merely keeping them company for \n","a while. he had eaten most, talked most, and \n","laughed most. but now he simply was not there \n","at all! \n","\n","\n","\"just when a wizard would have been most \n","useful, too,\" groaned dori and nori (who shared \n","the hobbit's views about regular meals, plenty \n","and often). \n","\n","they decided in the end that they would \n","have to camp where they were. they moved to \n","a clump of trees, and though it was drier under \n","them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, \n","and the drip, drip, was most annoying. also the \n","mischief seemed to have got into the fire. \n","dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out \n","of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they \n","could not do it that night, not even oin and \n","gloin, who were specially good at it. \n","\n","then one of the ponies took fright at nothing \n","and bolted. he got into the river before they \n","could catch him; and before they could get him \n","out again, fili and kili were nearly drowned, \n","\n","\n","\n","and all the baggage that he carried was \n","washed away off him. of course it was mostly \n","food, and there was mighty little left for supper, \n","and less for breakfast. \n","\n","there they all sat glum and wet and \n","muttering, while oin and gloin went on trying to \n","light the fire, and quarrelling about it. bilbo was \n","sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony- \n","rides in may-sunshine, when balin, who was \n","always their look-out man, said: \"there's a light \n","over there!\" there was a hill some way off with \n","trees on it, pretty thick in parts. out of the dark \n","mass of the trees they could now see a light \n","shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as \n","it might be a fire or torches twinkling. \n","\n","when they had looked at it for some while, \n","they fell to arguing. some said \"no\" and some \n","said \"yes\". some said they could but go and \n","see, and anything was better than little supper, \n","less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night. \n","\n","others said: \"these parts are none too well \n","known, and are too near the mountains. \n","travellers seldom come this way now. the old \n","maps are no use: things have changed for the \n","worse and the road is unguarded. they have \n","seldom even heard of the king round here, and \n","the less inquisitive you are as you go along, the \n","less trouble you are likely to find.\" some said: \n","\"after all there are fourteen of us.\" others said: \n","\"where has gandalf got to?\" this remark was \n","repeated by everybody. then the rain began to \n","pour down worse than ever, and oin and gloin \n","began to fight. \n","\n","that settled it. \"after all we have got a \n","burglar with us,\" they said; and so they made \n","\n","\n","\n","off, leading their ponies (with all due and proper \n","caution) in the direction of the light. they came \n","to the hill and were soon in the wood. up the hill \n","they went; but there was no proper path to be \n","seen, such as might lead to a house or a farm; \n","and do what they could they made a deal of \n","rustling and crackling and creaking (and a good \n","deal of grumbling and drafting), as they went \n","through the trees in the pitch dark. \n","\n","suddenly the red light shone out very bright \n","through the tree-trunks not far ahead. \n","\n","\"now it is the burglar's turn,\" they said, \n","meaning bilbo. \"you must go on and find out all \n","about that light, and what it is for, and if all is \n","perfectly safe and canny,\" said thorin to the \n","hobbit. \"now scuttle off, and come back quick, if \n","all is well. if not, come back if you can! if you \n","can't, hoot twice like a barn-owl and once like a \n","screech-owl, and we will do what we can.\" \n","\n","off bilbo had to go, before he could explain \n","that he could not hoot even once like any kind of \n","owl any more than fly like a bat. but at any rate \n","hobbits can move quietly in woods, absolutely \n","quietly. they take a pride in it, and bilbo had \n","sniffed more than once at what he called \"all this \n","dwarvish racket,\" as they went along, though i \n","don't suppose you or i would have noticed \n","anything at all on a windy night, not if the whole \n","cavalcade had passed two feet off. as for bilbo \n","walking primly towards the red light, i don't \n","suppose even a weasel would have stirred a \n","whisker at it. so, naturally, he got right up to the \n","fire - for fire it was - without disturbing anyone. \n","and this is what he saw. \n","\n","three very large persons sitting round a \n","\n","\n","\n","very large fire of beech-logs. they were \n","toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and \n","licking the gravy off their fingers. there was a \n","fine toothsome smell. also there was a barrel of \n","good drink at hand, and they were drinking out \n","of jugs. but they were trolls. obviously trolls. \n","even bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could \n","see that: from the great heavy faces of them, \n","and theirsize, and the shape oftheirlegs, not to \n","mention their language, which was not drawing- \n","room fashion at all, at all. \n","\n","\"mutton yesterday, mutton today, and \n","blimey, if it don't look like mutton again \n","tomorrer,\" said one of the trolls. \n","\n","\"never a blinking bit of manflesh have we \n","had for long enough,\" said a second. \"what the \n","'ell william was a-thinkin' of to bring us into \n","these parts at all, beats me - and the drink \n","runnin' short, what's more,\" he said jogging the \n","elbow of william, who was taking a pull at his \n","\n","jug. \n","\n","william choked. \"shut yer mouth!\" he said \n","as soon as he could. \"yer can't expect folk to \n","stop here for ever just to be et by you and bert. \n","you've et a village and a half between yer, since \n","we come down from the mountains. how much \n","more d'yer want? and time's been up our way \n","when yer'd have said 'thank yer bill' for a nice \n","bit o' fat valley mutton like what this is.\" he took \n","a big bite off a sheep's leg he was roasting, \n","and wiped his lips on his sleeve. \n","\n","yes, i am afraid trolls do behave like that, \n","even those with only one head each. after \n","hearing all this bilbo ought to have done \n","something at once. either he should have gone \n","\n","\n","\n","back quietly and warned his friends that there \n","were three fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty \n","mood, quite likely to try roasted dwarf, or even \n","pony, for a change; or else he should have done \n","a bit of good quick burgling. a really first-class \n","and legendary burglar would at this point have \n","picked the trolls' pockets - it is nearly always \n","worth while, if you can manage it - , pinched the \n","very mutton off the spits, purloined the beer, and \n","walked off without their noticing him. others \n","more practical but with less professional pride \n","would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each \n","of them before they observed it. then the night \n","could have been spent cheerily. \n","\n","bilbo knew it. he had read of a good many \n","things he had never seen or done. he was very \n","much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished \n","himself a hundred miles away, and yet - and yet \n","somehow he could not go straight back to \n","thorin and company emptyhanded. so he \n","stood and hesitated in the shadows. of the \n","various burglarious proceedings he had heard \n","of picking the trolls' pockets seemed the least \n","difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just \n","behind william. \n","\n","bert and tom went off to the barrel. william \n","was having another drink. then bilbo plucked \n","up courage and put his little hand in william's \n","enormous pocket. there was a purse in it, as \n","big as a bag to bilbo. \"ha!\" thought he, \n","warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully \n","out, \"this is a beginning!\" \n","\n","it was! trolls' purses are the mischief, and \n","this was no exception. \"'ere, 'oo are you?\" it \n","squeaked, as it left the pocket; and william \n","\n","\n","\n","turned round at once and grabbed bilbo by the \n","neck, before he could duck behind the tree. \n","\n","\"blimey, bert, look what i've copped!\" said \n","william. \n","\n","\"what is it?\" said the others coming up. \n","\n","\"lumme, if i knows! what are yer?\" \n","\n","\"bilbo baggins, a bur - a hobbit,\" said poor \n","bilbo, shaking all over, and wondering how to \n","make owl-noises before they throttled him. \n","\n","\"a burrahobbit?\" said they a bit startled. \n","trolls are slow in the uptake, and mighty \n","suspicious about anything new to them. \n","\n","\"what's a burrahobbit got to do with my \n","pocket, anyways?\" said william. \n","\n","\"and can yer cook 'em?\" said tom. \n","\n","\"yer can try,\" said bert, picking up a \n","skewer. \n","\n","\"he wouldn't make above a mouthful,\" said \n","william, who had already had a fine supper, \n","\"not when he was skinned and boned.\" \n","\n","\"p'raps there are more like him round \n","about, and we might make a pie,\" said bert. \n","\"here you, are there any more of your sort a- \n","sneakin' in these here woods, yer nassty little \n","rabbit,\" said he looking at the hobbit's furry feet; \n","and he picked him up by the toes and shook \n","him. \n","\n","\"yes, lots,\" said bilbo, before he \n","remembered not to give his friends away. \"no \n","none at all, not one,\" he said immediately \n","afterwards. \n","\n","\"what d'yer mean?\" said bert, holding him \n","right way up, bythe hairthis time. \n","\n","\"what i say,\" said bilbo gasping. \"and \n","please don't cook me, kind sirs! i am a good \n","\n","\n","\n","cook myself, and cook better than i cook, if you \n","see what i mean. i'll cook beautifully for you, a \n","perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you \n","won't have me for supper.\" \n","\n","\"poor little blighter,\" said william. he had \n","already had as much supper as he could hold; \n","also he had had lots of beer. \"poor little \n","blighter! let him go!\" \n","\n","\"not till he says what he means by lots and \n","none at all,\" said bert. \"i don't want to have me \n","throat cut in me sleep! hold his toes in the fire, \n","till he talks!\" \n","\n","\"i won't have it,\" said william. \"i caught him \n","anyway.\" \n","\n","\"you're a fat fool, william,\" said bert, \"as \n","i've said afore this evening.\" \n","\n","\"and you're a lout!\" \n","\n","\"and i won't take that from you, bill \n","huggins,\" says bert, and puts his fist in \n","william's eye. \n","\n","then there was a gorgeous row. bilbo had \n","just enough wits left, when bert dropped him on \n","the ground, to scramble out of the way of their \n","feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and \n","calling one another all sorts of perfectly true and \n","applicable names in very loud voices. soon \n","they were locked in one another's arms, and \n","rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, \n","while tom whacked at them both with a branch \n","to bring them to their senses - and that of \n","course only made them madder than ever. \n","\n","that would have been the time for bilbo to \n","have left. but his poor little feet had been very \n","squashed in bert's big paw, and he had no \n","breath in his body, and his head was going \n","\n","\n","\n","round; so there he lay for a while panting, just \n","outside the circle of firelight. \n","\n","right in the middle of the fight up came \n","balin. the dwarves had heard noises from a \n","distance, and after waiting for some time for \n","bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they \n","started off one by one to creep towards the light \n","as quietly as they could. no sooner did tom \n","see balin come into the light than he gave an \n","awful howl. trolls simply detest the very sight of \n","dwarves (uncooked). bert and bill stopped \n","fighting immediately, and \"a sack, tom, quick!\" \n","they said. before balin, who was wondering \n","where in all this commotion bilbo was, knew \n","what was happening, a sack was over his head, \n","and he was down. \n","\n","\"there's more to come yet,\" said tom, \"or \n","i'm mighty mistook. lots and none at all, it is,\" \n","said he. \"no burrahobbits, but lots of these here \n","dwarves. that's about the shape of it!\" \n","\n","\"i reckon you're right,\" said bert, \"and we'd \n","best get out of the light.\" \n","\n","and so they did. with sacks in their hands, \n","that they used for carrying off mutton and other \n","plunder, they waited in the shadows. as each \n","dwarf came up and looked at the fire, and the \n","spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in \n","surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his \n","head, and he was down. soon dwalin lay by \n","balin, and fili and kili together, and dori and \n","nori and ori all in a heap, and oin and gloin \n","and bifur and bofur and bombur piled \n","uncomfortably near the fire. \n","\n","\"that'll teach 'em,\" said tom; for bifur and \n","bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought \n","\n","\n","\n","[ike mad, as dwarves will when cornered. \n","\n","thorin came last - and he was not caught \n","unawares. he came expecting mischief, and \n","didn't need to see his friends' legs sticking out \n","of sacks to tell him that things were not all well. \n","he stood outside in the shadows some way off, \n","and said: \"what's all this trouble? who has \n","been knocking my people about?\" \n","\n","\"it's trolls!\" said bilbo from behind a tree. \n","they had forgotten all about him. \"they're \n","hiding in the bushes with sacks,\" said he. \n","\n","\"o! are they?\" said thorin, and he jumped \n","forward to the fire, before they could leap on \n","him. he caught up a big branch all on fire at one \n","end: and bert got that end in his eye before he \n","could step aside. that put him out of the battle \n","for a bit. bilbo did his best. he caught hold of \n","tom's leg - as well as he could, it was thick as \n","a young tree-trunk - but he was sent spinning \n","up into the top of some bushes, when tom \n","kicked the sparks up in thorin's face. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the trolls \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and \n","lost one of the front ones. it made him howl, i \n","can tell you. but just at that moment william \n","came up behind and popped a sack right over \n","thorin's head and down to his toes. and so the \n","fight ended. a nice pickle they were all in now: \n","all neatly tied up in sacks, with three angry trolls \n","(and two with burns and bashes to remember) \n","sitting by them, arguing whether they should \n","roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil \n","them, or just sit on them one by one and squash \n","them into jelly; and bilbo up in a bush, with his \n","clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for \n","fear they should hear him. \n","\n","\n","it was just then that gandalf came back. but no \n","one saw him. the trolls had just decided to \n","roast the dwarves now and eat them later - that \n","was bert's idea, and after a lot of argument they \n","had all agreed to it. \n","\n","\"no good roasting 'em now, it'd take all \n","night,\" said a voice. bert thought it was \n","william's. \n","\n","\"don't start the argument all over again, \n","bill,\" he said, \"or it wll take all night.\" \n","\n","\"who's a-arguing?\" said william, who \n","thought it was bert that had spoken. \n","\n","\"you are,\" said bert. \n","\n","\"you're a liar,\" said william; and so the \n","argument began all over again. in the end they \n","decided to mince them fine and boil them. so \n","they got a great black pot, and they took out \n","their knives. \n","\n","\"no good boiling 'em! we ain't got no \n","\n","\n","\n","water, and it's a long way to the well and all,\" \n","said a voice. bert and william thought it was \n","tom's. \n","\n","\"shut up!\" said they, \"or we'll never have \n","done. and yer can fetch the water yerself, if yer \n","say any more.\" \n","\n","\"shut up yerself!\" said tom, who thought it \n","was william's voice. \"who's arguing but you, i'd \n","like to know.\" \n","\n","\"you're a booby,\" said william. \n","\n","\"booby yerself!\" said tom. \n","\n","and so the argument began all over again, \n","and went on hotter than ever, until at last they \n","decided to sit on the sacks one by one and \n","squash them, and boil them next time. \n","\n","\"who shall we sit on first?\" said the voice. \n","\n","\"better sit on the last fellow first,\" said bert, \n","whose eye had been damaged by thorin. he \n","thought tom was talking. \n","\n","\"don't talk to yerself!\" said tom. \"but if you \n","wants to sit on the last one, sit on him. which is \n","he?\" \n","\n","\"the one with the yellow stockings,\" said \n","bert. \n","\n","\"nonsense, the one with the grey \n","stockings,\" said a voice like william's. \n","\n","\"i made sure it was yellow,\" said bert. \n","\n","\"yellow it was,\" said william. \n","\n","\"then what did yer say it was grey for?\" \n","said bert. \n","\n","\"i never did. tom said it.\" \n","\n","\"that i never did!\" said tom. \"it was you.\" \n","\n","\"two to one, so shut yer mouth!\" said bert. \n","\n","\"who are you a-talkin' to?\" said william. \n","\n","\"now stop it!\" said tom and bert together. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"the night's gettin' on, and dawn comes early. \n","let's get on with it!\" \n","\n","\"dawn take you all, and be stone to you!\" \n","said a voice that sounded like william's. but it \n","wasn't. for just at that moment the light came \n","over the hill, and there was a mighty twitter in \n","the branches. william never spoke for he stood \n","turned to stone as he stooped; and bert and \n","tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at \n","him. and there they stand to this day, all alone, \n","unless the birds perch on them; for trolls, as you \n","probably know, must be underground before \n","dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the \n","mountains they are made of, and never move \n","again. that is what had happened to bert and \n","tom and william. \n","\n","\"excellent!\" said gandalf, as he stepped \n","from behind a tree, and helped bilbo to climb \n","down out of a thorn-bush. then bilbo \n","understood. it was the wizard's voice that had \n","kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the \n","light came and made an end of them. \n","\n","the next thing was to untie the sacks and let \n","out the dwarves. they were nearly suffocated, \n","and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed \n","lying there listening to the trolls making plans for \n","roasting them and squashing them and mincing \n","them. they had to hear bilbo's account of what \n","had happened to him twice over, before they \n","were satisfied. \n","\n","\"silly time to go practising pinching and \n","pocket-picking,\" said bombur, \"when what we \n","wanted was fire and food!\" \n","\n","\"and that's just what you wouldn't have got \n","of those fellows without a struggle, in any case,\" \n","\n","\n","\n","said gandalf. \"anyhow you are wasting time \n","now. don't you realize that the trolls must have a \n","cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide \n","from the sun in? we must look into it!\" \n","\n","they searched about, and soon found the \n","marks of trolls' stony boots going away through \n","the trees. they followed the tracks up the hill, \n","until hidden by bushes they came on a big door \n","of stone leading to a cave. but they could not \n","open it, not though they all pushed while \n","gandalf tried various incantations. \n","\n","\"would this be any good?\" asked bilbo, \n","when they were getting tired and angry. \"i found \n","it on the ground where the trolls had their fight.\" \n","he held out a largish key, though no doubt \n","william had thought it very small and secret. it \n","must have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, \n","before he was turned to stone. \n","\n","\"why on earth didn't you mention it before?\" \n","they cried. gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into \n","the keyhole. then the stone door swung back \n","with one big push, and they all went inside. \n","there were bones on the floor and a nasty smell \n","was in the air; but there was a good deal of \n","food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on the \n","ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all \n","sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold \n","coins standing in a corner. there were lots of \n","clothes, too, hanging on the walls - too small for \n","trolls, i am afraid they belonged to victims - and \n","among them were several swords of various \n","makes, shapes, and sizes. two caught their \n","eyes particularly, because of their beautiful \n","scabbards and jewelled hilts. \n","\n","gandalf and thorin each took one of these; \n","\n","\n","\n","and bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. it \n","would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a \n","troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the \n","hobbit. \n","\n","\"these look like good blades,\" said the \n","wizard, half drawing them and looking at them \n","curiously. \"they were not made by any troll, nor \n","by any smith among men in these parts and \n","days; but when we can read the runes on them, \n","we shall know more about them.\" \n","\n","\"let's get out of this horrible smell!\" said \n","fili. so they carried out the pots of coins, and \n","such food as was untouched and looked fit to \n","eat, also one barrel of ale which was still full. by \n","that time they felt like breakfast, and being very \n","hungry they did not turn their noses up at what \n","they had got from the trolls' larder. their own \n","provisions were very scanty. now they had \n","bread and cheese, and plenty of ale, and bacon \n","to toast in the embers of the fire. \n","\n","after that they slept, for their night had been \n","disturbed; and they did nothing more till the \n","afternoon. then they brought up their ponies, \n","and carried away the pots of gold, and buried \n","them very secretly not far from the track by the \n","river, putting a great many spells over them, just \n","in case they ever had the chance to come back \n","and recover them. when that was done, they all \n","mounted once more, and jogged along again \n","on the path towards the east. \n","\n","\"where did you go to, if i may ask?\" said \n","thorin to gandalf as they rode along. \n","\n","\"to look ahead,\" said he. \n","\n","\"and what brought you back in the nick of \n","time?\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"looking behind,\" said he. \n","\n","\"exactly!\" said thorin; \"but could you be \n","more plain?\" \n","\n","\"i went on to spy out our road. it will soon \n","become dangerous and difficult. also i was \n","anxious about replenishing our small stock of \n","provisions. i had not gone very far, however, \n","when i met a couple of friends of mine from \n","rivendell.\" \n","\n","\"where's that?\" asked bilbo. \n","\n","\"don't interrupt!\" said gandalf. \"you will get \n","there in a few days now, if we're lucky, and find \n","out all about it. as i was saying i met two of \n","elrond's people. they were hurrying along for \n","fear of the trolls. it was they who told me that \n","three of them had come down from the \n","mountains and settled in the woods not far from \n","the road: they had frightened everyone away \n","from the district, and they waylaid strangers. \n","\n","\"i immediately had a feeling that i was \n","wanted back. looking behind i saw a fire in the \n","distance and made for it. so now you know. \n","please be more careful, next time, or we shall \n","never get anywhere!\" \n","\n","\"thank you!\" said thorin. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter iii \n","\n","\n","a short rest \n","\n","\n","they did not sing or tell stories that day, even \n","though the weather improved; nor the next day, \n","nor the day after. they had begun to feel that \n","danger was not far away on either side. they \n","camped under the stars, and their horses had \n","more to eat than they had; for there was plenty \n","of grass, but there was not much in their bags, \n","even with what they had got from the trolls. one \n","morning they forded a river at a wide shallow \n","place full of the noise of stones and foam. the \n","far bank was steep and slippery. when they got \n","to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw \n","that the great mountains had marched down \n","very near to them. already they seemed only a \n","day's easy journey from the feet of the nearest. \n","dark and drear it looked, though there were \n","patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and \n","behind its shoulders the tips of snow-peaks \n","gleamed. \n","\n","\n","\"is that the mountain?\" asked bilbo in a \n","solemn voice, looking at it with round eyes. he \n","had never seen a thing that looked so big \n","before. \n","\n","\"of course not!\" said balin. \"that is only the \n","beginning of the misty mountains, and we have \n","got to get through, or over, or under those \n","somehow, before we can come into wilderland \n","beyond. and it is a deal of a way even from the \n","other side of them to the lonely mountain in the \n","east where smaug lies on our treasure.\" \n","\n","\"o!\" said bilbo, and just at that moment he \n","felt more tired than he ever remembered feeling \n","before. he was thinking once again of his \n","comfortable chair before the fire in his favourite \n","sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle \n","singing. not for the last time! \n","\n","\n","now gandalf led the way. \"we must not miss \n","the road, or we shall be done for,\" he said. \"we \n","need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable \n","safety - also it is very necessary to tackle the \n","misty mountains by the proper path, or else you \n","will get lost in them, and have to come back and \n","start at the beginning again (if you ever get \n","back at all).\" \n","\n","they asked him where he was making for, \n","\n","\n","\n","and he answered: \"you are come to the very \n","edge of the wild, as some of you may know. \n","hidden somewhere ahead of us is the fair \n","valley of rivendell where elrond lives in the last \n","homely house. i sent a message by my friends, \n","and we are expected.\" \n","\n","that sounded nice and comforting, but they \n","had not got there yet, and it was not so easy as \n","it sounds to find the last homely house west of \n","the mountains. there seemed to be no trees \n","and no valleys and no hills to break the ground \n","in front of them, only one vast slope going slowly \n","up and up to meet the feet of the nearest \n","mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and \n","crumbling rock, with patches and slashes of \n","grass-green and moss-green showing where \n","water might be. \n","\n","morning passed, afternoon came; but in all \n","the silent waste there was no sign of any \n","dwelling. they were growing anxious, for they \n","saw now that the house might be hidden almost \n","anywhere between them and the mountains. \n","they came on unexpected valleys, narrow with \n","steep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet, \n","and they looked down surprised to see trees \n","below them and running water at the bottom. \n","there were gullies that they could almost leap \n","over, but very deep with waterfalls in them. \n","there were dark ravines that one could neither \n","\n","\n","\n","jump over nor climb into. there were bogs, \n","some of them green pleasant places to look at, \n","with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony \n","that walked there with a pack on its back would \n","never have come out again. \n","\n","it was indeed a much wider land from the \n","ford to the mountains than ever you would have \n","guessed. bilbo was astonished. the only path \n","was marked with white stones, some of which \n","were small, and others were half covered with \n","moss or heather. altogether it was a very slow \n","business following the track, even guided by \n","gandalf, who seemed to know his way about \n","pretty well. \n","\n","his head and beard wagged this way and \n","that as he looked for the stones, and they \n","followed his lead, but they seemed no nearer to \n","the end of the search when the day began to \n","fail. tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed \n","supper-time would soon do the same. there \n","were moths fluttering about, and the light \n","became very dim, for the moon had not risen. \n","bilbo's pony began to stumble over roots and \n","stones. they came to the edge of a steep fall in \n","the ground so suddenly that gandalfs horse \n","nearly slipped down the slope. \n","\n","\"here it is at last!\" he called, and the others \n","gathered round him and looked over the edge. \n","they saw a valley far below. they could hear \n","\n","\n","\n","the voice of hurrying water in a rocky bed at the \n","bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and \n","there was a light on the valley-side across the \n","water. \n","\n","bilbo never forgot the way they slithered \n","and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig-zag \n","path into the secret valley of rivendell. the air \n","grew warmer as they got lower, and the smell of \n","the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every \n","now and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or \n","bumped his nose on the pony's neck. their \n","spirits rose as they went down and down. the \n","trees changed to beech and oak, and there was \n","a comfortable feeling in the twilight. the last \n","green had almost faded out of the grass, when \n","they came at length to an open glade not far \n","above the banks of the stream. \n","\n","\"hmmm! it smells like elves!\" thought bilbo, \n","and he looked up at the stars. they were \n","burning bright and blue. just then there came a \n","burst of song like laughter in the trees: \n","\n","\n","o! what are you doing, \n","\n","and where are you going? \n","your ponies need shoeing! \n","the river is flowing! \n","\n","o! tra-la-la-lally \n","here down in the valley! \n","\n","\n","\n","o! what are you seeking, \n","and where are you making? \n","the faggots are reeking, \n","\n","the bannocks are baking! \n","0! tril-lil-lil-lolly \n","the valley is jolly, \n","ha! ha! \n","\n","\n","0! where are you going \n","with beards all a-wagging? \n","no knowing, no knowing \n","what brings mister baggins \n","and balin and dwalin \n","down into the valley \n","in june \n","ha! ha! \n","\n","\n","0! will you be staying, \n","\n","or will you be flying? \n","your ponies are straying! \n","the daylight is dying! \n","\n","\n","\n","to fly would be folly, \n","\n","to stay would be jolly \n","and listen and hark \n","till the end of the dark \n","to our tune \n","ha! ha! \n","\n","\n","so they laughed and sang in the trees; and \n","pretty fair nonsense i daresay you think it. not \n","that they would care; they would only laugh all \n","the more if you told them so. they were elves of \n","course. soon bilbo caught glimpses of them as \n","the darkness deepened. he loved elves, though \n","he seldom met them; but he was a little \n","frightened of them too. dwarves don't get on \n","well with them. even decent enough dwarves \n","like thorin and his friends think them foolish \n","(which is a very foolish thing to think), or get \n","annoyed with them. for some elves tease them \n","and laugh at them, and most of all at their \n","beards. \n","\n","\"well, well!\" said a voice. \"just look! bilbo \n","the hobbit on a pony, my dear! isn't it delicious!\" \n","\n","\"most astonishing wonderful!\" \n","\n","then off they went into another song as \n","ridiculous as the one i have written down in full. \n","at last one, a tall young fellow, came out from \n","the trees and bowed to gandalf and to thorin. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"welcome to the valley!\" he said. \n","\n","\"thank you!\" said thorin a bit gruffly; but \n","gandalf was already off his horse and among \n","the elves, talking merrily with them. \n","\n","\"you are a little out of your way,\" said the elf: \n","\"that is, if you are making for the only path \n","across the water and to the house beyond. we \n","will set you right, but you had best get on foot, \n","until you are over the bridge. are you going to \n","stay a bit and sing with us, or will you go straight \n","on? supper is preparing over there,\" he said. \"i \n","can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.\" \n","\n","tired as he was, bilbo would have liked to \n","stay a while. elvish singing is not a thing to \n","miss, in june under the stars, not if you care for \n","such things. also he would have liked to have a \n","few private words with these people that \n","seemed to know his names and all about him, \n","although he had never seen them before. he \n","thought their opinion of his adventure might be \n","interesting. elves know a lot and are wondrous \n","folk for news, and know what is going on among \n","the peoples of the land, as quick as water flows, \n","or quicker. \n","\n","but the dwarves were all for supper as soon \n","as possible just then, and would not stay. on \n","they all went, leading their ponies, till they were \n","brought to a good path and so at last to the very \n","brink of the river. it was flowing fast and noisily, \n","\n","\n","\n","as mountain-streams do of a summer evening, \n","when sun has been all day on the snow far up \n","above. there was only a narrow bridge of stone \n","without a parapet, as narrow as a pony could \n","well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow \n","and careful, one by one, each leading his pony \n","by the bridle. the elves had brought bright \n","lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry \n","song as the party went across. \n","\n","\"don't dip your beard in the foam, father!\" \n","they cried to thorin, who was bent almost on to \n","his hands and knees. \"it is long enough without \n","watering it.\" \n","\n","\"mind bilbo doesn't eat all the cakes!\" they \n","called. \"he is too fat to get through key-holes \n","yet!\" \n","\n","\"hush, hush! good people! and good \n","night!\" said gandalf, who came last. \"valleys \n","have ears, and some elves have over merry \n","tongues. good night!\" \n","\n","and so at last they all came to the last \n","homely house, and found its doors flung wide. \n","\n","\n","now it is a strange thing, but things that are \n","good to have and days that are good to spend \n","are soon told about, and not much to listen to; \n","while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, \n","\n","\n","\n","and even gruesome, may make a good tale, \n","and take a deal of telling anyway. they stayed \n","long in that good house, fourteen days at least, \n","and they found it hard to leave. bilbo would \n","gladly have stopped there for ever and ever - \n","even supposing a wish would have taken him \n","right back to his hobbit-hole without trouble. yet \n","there is little to tell about their stay. \n","\n","the master of the house was an elf-friend - \n","one of those people whose fathers came into \n","the strange stories before the beginning of \n","history, the wars of the evil goblins and the \n","elves and the first men in the north. in those \n","days of our tale there were still some people \n","who had both elves and heroes of the north for \n","ancestors, and elrond the master of the house \n","was their chief. \n","\n","he was as noble and as fair in face as an \n","elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a \n","wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and \n","as kind as summer. he comes into many tales, \n","but his part in the story of bilbo's great \n","adventure is only a small one, though important, \n","as you will see, if we ever get to the end of it. \n","his house was perfect, whether you liked food, \n","or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or singing, or \n","just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant \n","mixture of them all. evil things did not come into \n","that valley. \n","\n","\n","\n","i wish i had time to tell you even a few of the \n","tales or one or two of the songs that they heard \n","in that house. all of them, the ponies as well, \n","grew refreshed and strong in a few days there. \n","their clothes were mended as well as their \n","bruises, their tempers and their hopes. their \n","bags were filled with food and provisions light \n","to carry but strong to bring them over the \n","mountain passes. their plans were improved \n","with the best advice. so the time came to \n","midsummer eve, and they were to go on again \n","with the early sun on midsummer morning. \n","\n","elrond knew all about runes of every kind. \n","that day he looked at the swords they had \n","brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: \"these \n","are not troll-make. they are old swords, very old \n","swords of the high elves of the west, my kin. \n","they were made in gondolin for the goblin- \n","wars. they must have come from a dragon's \n","hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and \n","goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. \n","this, thorin, the runes name orcrist, the goblin- \n","cleaver in the ancient tongue of gondolin; it was \n","a famous blade. this, gandalf, was glamdring, \n","foe-hammer that the king of gondolin once \n","wore. keep them well!\" \n","\n","\"whence did the trolls get them, i wonder?\" \n","said thorin looking at his sword with new \n","interest. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"i could not say,\" said elrond, \"but one may \n","guess that your trolls had plundered other \n","plunderers, or come on the remnants of old \n","robberies in some hold in the mountains. i have \n","heard that there are still forgotten treasures of \n","old to be found in the deserted caverns of the \n","mines of moria, since the dwarf and goblin \n","war.\" \n","\n","thorin pondered these words. \"i will keep \n","this sword in honour,\" he said. \"may it soon \n","cleave goblins once again!\" \n","\n","\"a wish that is likely to be granted soon \n","enough in the mountains!\" said elrond. \"but \n","show me now your map!\" \n","\n","he took it and gazed long at it, and he \n","shook his head; for if he did not altogether \n","approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he \n","hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and \n","he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of \n","dale and its merry bells, and the burned banks \n","of the bright river running. the moon was \n","shining in a broad silver crescent. he held up \n","the map and the white light shone through it. \n","\"what is this?\" he said. \"there are moon-letters \n","here, beside the plain runes which say 'five feet \n","high the door and three may walk abreast.'\" \n","\n","\"what are moon-letters?\" asked the hobbit \n","full of excitement. he loved maps, as i have told \n","you before; and he also liked runes and letters \n","\n","\n","\n","and cunning handwriting, though when he wrote \n","himself it was a bit thin and spidery. \n","\n","\"moon-letters are rune-letters, but you \n","cannot see them,\" said elrond, \"not when you \n","look straight at them. they can only be seen \n","when the moon shines behind them, and what is \n","more, with the more cunning sort it must be a \n","moon of the same shape and season as the \n","day when they were written. the dwarves \n","invented them and wrote them with silver pens, \n","as your friends could tell you. these must have \n","been written on a midsummer's eve in a \n","crescent moon, a long while ago.\" \n","\n","\"what do they say?\" asked gandalf and \n","thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even \n","elrond should have found this out first, though \n","really there had not been a chance before, and \n","there would not have been another until \n","goodness knows when. \n","\n","\"stand by the grey stone when the thrush \n","\n","knocks. \" read elrond, \"and the setting sun with \n","the last light of durin's day will shine upon the \n","key-hole.\" \n","\n","\"durin, durin!\" said thorin. \"he was the \n","father of the fathers of the eldest race of \n","dwarves, the longbeards, and my first \n","ancestor: i am his heir.\" \n","\n","\"then what is durin's day?\" asked elrond. \n","\n","\"the first day of the dwarves' new year,\" \n","\n","\n","said thorin, \"is as all should know the first day \n","of the last moon of autumn on the threshold of \n","winter. we still call it durin's day when the last \n","moon of autumn and the sun are in the sky \n","together. but this will not help us much, i fear, for \n","it passes our skill in these days to guess when \n","such a time will come again.\" \n","\n","\"that remains to be seen,\" said gandalf. \"is \n","there any more writing?\" \n","\n","\"none to be seen by this moon,\" said \n","elrond, and he gave the map back to thorin; \n","and then they went down to the water to see the \n","elves dance and sing upon the midsummer's \n","eve. \n","\n","the next morning was a midsummer's \n","morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamed: \n","blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing \n","on the water. now they rode away amid songs \n","of farewell and good speed, with their hearts \n","ready for more adventure, and with a \n","knowledge of the road they must follow over the \n","misty mountains to the land beyond. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter iv \n","\n","\n","over hill and under hill \n","\n","\n","there were many paths that led up into those \n","mountains, and many passes over them. but \n","most of the paths were cheats and deceptions \n","and led nowhere or to bad ends; and most of \n","the passes were infested by evil things and \n","dreadful dangers. the dwarves and the hobbit, \n","helped by the wise advice of elrond and the \n","knowledge and memory of gandalf, took the \n","right road to the right pass. \n","\n","long days after they had climbed out of the \n","valley and left the last homely house miles \n","behind, they were still going up and up and up. it \n","was a hard path and a dangerous path, a \n","crooked way and a lonely and a long. now they \n","could look back over the lands they had left, laid \n","out behind them far below. far, far away in the \n","west, where things were blue and faint, bilbo \n","knew there lay his own country of safe and \n","comfortable things, and his little hobbit-hole. he \n","shivered. it was getting bitter cold up here, and \n","the wind came shrill among the rocks. boulders, \n","too, at times came galloping down the \n","mountain-sides, let loose by mid-day sun upon \n","\n","\n","the snow, and passed among them (which was \n","lucky), or over their heads (which was \n","alarming). the nights were comfortless and \n","chill, and they did not dare to sing or talk too \n","loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the \n","silence seemed to dislike being broken - \n","except by the noise of water and the wail of \n","wind and the crack of stone. \n","\n","\"the summer is getting on down below,\" \n","thought bilbo, \"and haymaking is going on and \n","picnics. they will be harvesting and \n","blackberrying, before we even begin to go \n","down the other side at this rate.\" and the others \n","were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although \n","when they had said good-bye to elrond in the \n","high hope of a midsummer morning, they had \n","spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains, \n","and of riding swift across the lands beyond. \n","they had thought of coming to the secret door \n","in the lonely mountain, perhaps that very next \n","last moon of autumn - \"and perhaps it will be \n","durin's day\" they had said. only gandalf had \n","shaken his head and said nothing. dwarves \n","had not passed that way for many years, but \n","gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger \n","had grown and thriven in the wild, since the \n","dragons had driven men from the lands, and the \n","goblins had spread in secret after the battle of \n","the mines of moria. even the good plans of \n","wise wizards like gandalf and of good friends \n","like elrond go astray sometimes when you are \n","off on dangerous adventures over the edge of \n","\n","\n","\n","the wild; and gandalf was a wise enough \n","wizard to know it. \n","\n","\n","he knew that something unexpected might \n","happen, and he hardly dared to hope that they \n","would pass without fearful adventure over those \n","great tall mountains with lonely peaks and \n","valleys where no king ruled. they did not. all \n","was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm \n","- more than a thunderstorm, a thunder-battle. \n","you know how terrific a really big thunderstorm \n","can be down in the land and in a river-valley; \n","especially at times when two great \n","thunderstorms meet and clash. more terrible \n","still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at \n","night, when storms come up from east and \n","west and make war. the lightning splinters on \n","the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes \n","split the air and go rolling and tumbling into \n","every cave and hollow; and the darkness is \n","filled with overwhelming noise and sudden light. \n","\n","bilbo had never seen or imagined anything \n","of the kind. they were high up in a narrow \n","place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at \n","one side of them. there they were sheltering \n","under a hanging rock for the night, and he lay \n","beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe. \n","when he peeped out in the lightning-flashes, he \n","saw that across the valley the stone-giants were \n","out, and were hurling rocks at one another for a \n","game, and catching them, and tossing them \n","\n","\n","\n","down into the darkness where they smashed \n","among the trees far below, or splintered into \n","little bits with a bang. then came a wind and a \n","rain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail \n","about in every direction, so that an overhanging \n","rock was no protection at all. soon they were \n","getting drenched and their ponies were \n","standing with their heads down and their tails \n","between their legs, and some of them were \n","whinnying with fright. they could hear the giants \n","guffawing and shouting all over the \n","mountainsides. \n","\n","\"this won't do at all!\" said thorin. \"if we \n","don't get blown off, or drowned, or struck by \n","lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant \n","and kicked sky-high for a football.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the mountain-path \n","\n","\n","\"well, if you know of anywhere better, take \n","us there!\" said gandalf, who was feeling very \n","grumpy, and was far from happy about the \n","giants himself. \n","\n","the end of their argument was that they \n","sent fili and kili to look for a better shelter. \n","they had very sharp eyes, and being the \n","youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years \n","they usually got these sort of jobs (when \n","everybody could see that it was absolutely no \n","use sending bilbo). there is nothing like \n","looking, if you want to find something (or so \n","thorin said to the young dwarves). you certainly \n","usually find something, if you look, but it is not \n","always quite the something you were after. so it \n","proved on this occasion. \n","\n","soon fili and kili came crawling back, \n","holding on to the rocks in the wind. \"we have \n","found a dry cave,\" they said, \"not far round the \n","next corner; and ponies and all could get \n","inside.\" \n","\n","\"flave you thoroughly explored it?\" said the \n","wizard, who knew that caves up in the \n","mountains were seldom unoccupied. \n","\n","\"yes, yes!\" they said, though everybody \n","knew they could not have been long about it; \n","they had come back too quick. \"it isn't all that \n","big, and it does not go far back.\" \n","\n","that, of course, is the dangerous part about \n","\n","\n","\n","caves: you don't know how far they go back, \n","sometimes, or where a passage behind may \n","lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. but \n","now fili and kili's news seemed good enough. \n","so they all got up and prepared to move. the \n","wind was howling and the thunder still growling, \n","and they had a business getting themselves \n","and their ponies along. still it was not very far to \n","go, and before long they came to a big rock \n","standing out into the path. if you stepped \n","behind, you found a low arch in the side of the \n","mountain. there was just room to get the \n","ponies through with a squeeze, when they had \n","been unpacked and unsaddled. as they passed \n","under the arch, it was good to hear the wind \n","and the rain outside instead of all about them, \n","and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks. \n","but the wizard was taking no risks. he lit up his \n","wand - as he did that day in bilbo's dining- \n","room that seemed so long ago, if you \n","remember - , and by its light they explored the \n","cave from end to end. \n","\n","it seemed quite a fair size, but not too large \n","and mysterious. it had a dry floor and some \n","comfortable nooks. at one end there was room \n","for the ponies; and there they stood (mighty \n","glad of the change) steaming, and champing in \n","their nosebags. oin and gloin wanted to light a \n","fire at the door to dry their clothes, but gandalf \n","would not hear of it. so they spread out their \n","wet things on the floor, and got dry ones out of \n","their bundles; then they made their blankets \n","\n","\n","\n","comfortable, got out their pipes and blew \n","smoke rings, which gandalf turned into different \n","colours and set dancing up by the roof to \n","amuse them. they talked and talked, and forgot \n","about the storm, and discussed what each \n","would do with his share of the treasure (when \n","they got it, which at the moment did not seem \n","so impossible); and so they dropped off to \n","sleep one by one. and that was the last time \n","that they used the ponies, packages, \n","baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they \n","had brought with them. \n","\n","it turned out a good thing that night that they \n","had brought little bilbo with them, after all. for, \n","somehow, he could not go to sleep for a long \n","while; and when he did sleep, he had very nasty \n","dreams. he dreamed that a crack in the wall at \n","the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and \n","opened wider and wider, and he was very \n","afraid but could not call out or do anything but \n","lie and look. then he dreamed that the floor of \n","the cave was giving way, and he was slipping - \n","beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows \n","where to. \n","\n","at that he woke up with a horrible start, and \n","found that part of his dream was true. a crack \n","had opened at the back of the cave, and was \n","already a wide passage. he was just in time to \n","see the last of the ponies' tails disappearing \n","into it. of course he gave a very loud yell, as \n","loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is \n","surprising for their size. \n","\n","\n","\n","out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great \n","ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you \n","could say rocks and blocks. there were six to \n","each dwarf, at least, and two even for bilbo; \n","and they were all grabbed and carried through \n","the crack, before you could say tinder and flint. \n","but not gandalf. bilbo's yell had done that much \n","good. it had wakened him up wide in a \n","splintered second, and when goblins came to \n","grab him, there was a terrific flash like lightning \n","in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several \n","of them fell dead. \n","\n","the crack closed with a snap, and bilbo \n","and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! \n","where was gandalf? of that neither they nor the \n","goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not \n","wait to find out. they seized bilbo and the \n","dwarves and hurried them along. it was deep, \n","deep, dark, such as only goblins that have \n","taken to living in the heart of the mountains can \n","see through. the passages there were crossed \n","and tangled in all directions, but the goblins \n","knew their way, as well as you do to the nearest \n","post-office; and the way went down and down, \n","and it was most horribly stuffy. the goblins were \n","very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and \n","chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony \n","voices; and bilbo was more unhappy even than \n","when the troll had picked him up by his toes. he \n","wished again and again for his nice bright \n","hobbit-hole. not for the last time. \n","\n","now there came a glimmer of a red light \n","\n","\n","\n","before them. the goblins began to sing, or \n","croak, keeping time with the flap of their flat feet \n","on the stone, and shaking their prisoners as \n","well. \n","\n","\n","clap! snap! the black crack! \n","grip, grab! pinch, nab! \n","\n","and down down to goblin-town \n","you go, my lad! \n","\n","\n","clash, crash! crush, smash! \n","\n","hammer and tongs! knocker and gongs! \n","pound, pound, far underground! \n","\n","ho, ho! my lad! \n","\n","\n","swish, smack! whip crack! \n","\n","batter and beat! yammer and bleat! \n","work, work! nor dare to shirk, \n","\n","while goblins quaff, and goblins laugh, \n","round and round far underground \n","below, my lad! \n","\n","\n","it sounded truly terrifying. the walls echoed \n","to the clap, snap! and the crush, smash\\ and to \n","the ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! the \n","\n","\n","\n","general meaning of the song was only too plain; \n","for now the goblins took out whips and whipped \n","them with a s\n","ish, smack!, and set them \n","running as fast as they could in front of them; \n","and more than one of the dwarves were already \n","yammering and bleating like anything, when \n","they stumbled into a big cavern. \n","\n","it was lit by a great red fire in the middle, \n","and by torches along the walls, and it was full of \n","goblins. they all laughed and stamped and \n","clapped their hands, when the dwarves (with \n","poor little bilbo at the back and nearest to the \n","whips) came running in, while the goblin-drivers \n","whooped and cracked their whips behind. the \n","ponies were already there huddled in a corner; \n","and there were all the baggages and packages \n","lying broken open, and being rummaged by \n","goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by \n","goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins. \n","\n","i am afraid that was the last they ever saw \n","of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly \n","sturdy little white fellow that elrond had lent to \n","gandalf, since his horse was not suitable for the \n","mountain-paths. for goblins eat horses and \n","ponies and donkeys (and other much more \n","dreadful things), and they are always hungry. \n","just now however the prisoners were thinking \n","only of themselves. the goblins chained their \n","hands behind their backs and linked them all \n","together in a line, and dragged them to the far \n","end of the cavern with little bilbo tugging at the \n","end of the row. \n","\n","\n","\n","there in the shadows on a large flat stone \n","sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, and \n","armed goblins were standing round him \n","carrying the axes and the bent swords that they \n","use. now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad- \n","hearted. they make no beautiful things, but they \n","make many clever ones. they can tunnel and \n","mine as well as any but the most skilled \n","dwarves, when they take the trouble, though \n","they are usually untidy and dirty. hammers, \n","axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and \n","also instruments of torture, they make very well, \n","or get other people to make to their design, \n","prisoners and slaves that have to work till they \n","die for want of air and light. it is not unlikely that \n","they invented some of the machines that have \n","since troubled the world, especially the \n","ingenious devices for killing large numbers of \n","people at once, for wheels and engines and \n","explosions always delighted them, and also not \n","working with their own hands more than they \n","could help; but in those days and those wild \n","parts they had not advanced (as it is called) so \n","far. they did not hate dwarves especially, no \n","more than they hated everybody and everything, \n","and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in \n","some parts wicked dwarves had even made \n","alliances with them. but they had a special \n","grudge against thorin's people, because of the \n","war which you have heard mentioned, but which \n","does not come into this tale; and anyway \n","goblins don't care who they catch, as long as it \n","\n","\n","\n","is done smart and secret, and the prisoners are \n","not able to defend themselves. \n","\n","\"who are these miserable persons?\" said \n","the great goblin. \n","\n","\"dwarves, and this!\" said one of the drivers, \n","pulling at bilbo's chain so that he fell forward \n","onto his knees. \"we found them sheltering in \n","our front porch.\" \n","\n","\"what do you mean by it?\" said the great \n","goblin turning to thorin. \"up to no good, i'll \n","warrant! spying on the private business of my \n","people, i guess! thieves, i shouldn't be \n","surprised to learn! murderers and friends of \n","elves, not unlikely! come! what have you got to \n","say?\" \n","\n","\"thorin the dwarf at your service!\" he \n","replied - it was merely a polite nothing. \"of the \n","things which you suspect and imagine we had \n","no idea at all. we sheltered from a storm in \n","what seemed a convenient cave and unused; \n","nothing was further from our thoughts than \n","inconveniencing goblins in any way whatever.\" \n","that was true enough! \n","\n","\"urn!\" said the great goblin. \"so you say! \n","might i ask what you were doing up in the \n","mountains at all, and where you were coming \n","from, and where you were going to? in fact i \n","should like to know all about you. not that it will \n","do you much good, thorin oakenshield, i know \n","too much about your folk already; but let's have \n","the truth, or i will prepare something particularly \n","uncomfortable for you!\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"we were on a journey to visit our relatives, \n","our nephews and nieces, and first, second, and \n","third cousins, and the other descendants of our \n","grandfathers, who live on the east side of these \n","truly hospitable mountains,\" said thorin, not \n","quite knowing what to say all at once in a \n","moment, when obviously the exact truth would \n","not do at all. \n","\n","\"he is a liar, o truly tremendous one!\" said \n","one of the drivers. \"several of our people were \n","struck by lightning in the cave, when we invited \n","these creatures to come below; and they are as \n","dead as stones. also he has not explained \n","this!\" he held out the sword which thorin had \n","worn, the sword which came from the trolls' lair. \n","\n","the great goblin gave a truly awful howl of \n","rage when he looked at it, and all his soldiers \n","gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and \n","stamped. they knew the sword at once. it had \n","killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the \n","fair elves of gondolin hunted them in the hills or \n","did battle before their walls. they had called it \n","orcrist, goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it \n","simply biter. they hated it and hated worse any \n","one that carried it. \n","\n","\"murderers and elf-friends!\" the great \n","goblin shouted. \"slash them! beat them! bite \n","them! gnash them! take them away to dark \n","holes full of snakes, and never let them see the \n","light again!\" he was in such a rage that he \n","jumped off his seat and himself rushed at thorin \n","with his mouth open. \n","\n","\n","\n","just at that moment all the lights in the \n","cavern went out, and the great fire went off \n","poof! into a tower of blue glowing smoke, right \n","up to the roof, that scattered piercing white \n","sparks all among the goblins. \n","\n","the yells and yammering, croaking, \n","jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and \n","curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed \n","were beyond description. several hundred wild \n","cats and wolves being roasted slowly alive \n","together would not have compared with it. the \n","sparks were burning holes in the goblins, and \n","the smoke that now fell from the roof made the \n","air too thick for even their eyes to see through. \n","soon they were falling over one another and \n","rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kicking \n","and fighting as if they had all gone mad. \n","\n","suddenly a sword flashed in its own light. \n","bilbo saw it go right through the great goblin \n","as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his \n","rage. he fell dead, and the goblin soldiers fled \n","before the sword shrieking into the darkness. \n","\n","the sword went back into its sheath. \n","\"follow me quick!\" said a voice fierce and \n","quiet; and before bilbo understood what had \n","happened he was trotting along again, as fast \n","as he could trot, at the end of the line, down \n","more dark passages with the yells of the goblin- \n","hall growing fainter behind him. a pale light was \n","leading them on. \n","\n","\"quicker, quicker!\" said the voice. \"the \n","torches will soon be relit.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"half a minute!\" said dori, who was at the \n","back next to bilbo, and a decent fellow. he \n","made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as \n","best he could with his tied hands, and then off \n","they all went at a run, with a clink-clink of chains, \n","and many a stumble, since they had no hands \n","to steady themselves with. not for a long while \n","did they stop, and by that time they must have \n","been right down in the very mountain's heart. \n","\n","then gandalf lit up his wand. of course it \n","was gandalf; but just then they were too busy to \n","ask how he got there. he took out his sword \n","again, and again it flashed in the dark by itself. \n","it burned with a rage that made it gleam if \n","goblins were about; now it was bright as blue \n","flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of \n","the cave. it made no trouble whatever of cutting \n","through the goblin-chains and setting all the \n","prisoners free as quickly as possible. this \n","sword's name was glamdring the foe-hammer, \n","if you remember. the goblins just called it \n","beater, and hated it worse than biter if \n","possible. orcrist, too, had been saved; for \n","gandalf had brought it along as well, snatching \n","it from one of the terrified guards. gandalf \n","thought of most things; and though he could not \n","do everything, he could do a great deal for \n","friends in a tight corner. \n","\n","\"are we all here?\" said he, handing his \n","sword back to thorin with a bow. \"let me see: \n","one - that's thorin; two, three, four, five, six, \n","seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; where are fili \n","\n","\n","\n","and kili? here they are! twelve, thirteen - and \n","here's mr. baggins: fourteen! well, well! it might \n","be worse, and then again it might be a good \n","deal better. no ponies, and no food, and no \n","knowing quite where we are, and hordes of \n","angry goblins just behind! on we go!\" \n","\n","on they went. gandalf was quite right: they \n","began to hear goblin noises and horrible cries \n","far behind in the passages they had come \n","through. that sent them on faster than ever, and \n","as poor bilbo could not possibly go half as fast \n","- for dwarves can roll along at a tremendous \n","pace, i can tell you, when they have to - they \n","took it in turn to carry him on their backs. \n","\n","still goblins go faster than dwarves, and \n","these goblins knew the way better (they had \n","made the paths themselves), and were madly \n","angry; so that do what they could the dwarves \n","heard the cries and howls getting closer and \n","closer. soon they could hear even the flap of the \n","goblin feet, many many feet which seemed only \n","just round the last corner. the blink of red \n","torches could be seen behind them in the tunnel \n","they were following; and they were getting \n","deadly tired. \n","\n","\"why, o why did i ever leave my hobbit- \n","hole!\" said poor mr. baggins bumping up and \n","down on bombur's back. \n","\n","\"why, o why did i ever bring a wretched \n","little hobbit on a treasure hunt!\" said poor \n","bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with \n","the sweat dripping down his nose in his heat \n","\n","\n","\n","and terror. \n","\n","at this point gandalf fell behind, and thorin \n","with him. they turned a sharp corner. \"about \n","turn!\" he shouted. \"draw your sword thorin!\" \n","\n","there was nothing else to be done; and the \n","goblins did not like it. they came scurrying \n","round the corner in full cry, and found goblin- \n","cleaver, and foe-hammer shining cold and \n","bright right in their astonished eyes. the ones in \n","front dropped their torches and gave one yell \n","before they were killed. the ones behind yelled \n","still more, and leaped back knocking over those \n","that were running after them. \"biter and beater!\" \n","they shrieked; and soon they were all in \n","confusion, and most of them were hustling back \n","the way they had come. \n","\n","it was quite a long while before any of them \n","dared to turn that corner. by that time the \n","dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way \n","on into the dark tunnels of the goblins' realm. \n","when the goblins discovered that, they put out \n","their torches and they slipped on soft shoes, \n","and they chose out their very quickest runners \n","with the sharpest ears and eyes. these ran \n","forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, and \n","with hardly any more noise than bats. \n","\n","that is why neither bilbo, nor the dwarves, \n","nor even gandalf heard them coming. nor did \n","they see them. but they were seen by the \n","goblins that ran silently up behind, for gandalf \n","was letting his wand give out a faint light to help \n","the dwarves as they went along. \n","\n","\n","\n","quite suddenly dori, now at the back again \n","carrying bilbo, was grabbed from behind in the \n","dark. he shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled \n","off his shoulders into the blackness, bumped \n","his head on hard rock, and remembered \n","nothing more. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter v \n","\n","\n","riddles in the dark \n","\n","\n","when bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if \n","he had; for it was just as dark as with them shut. \n","no one was anywhere near him. just imagine \n","his fright! he could hear nothing, see nothing, \n","and he could feel nothing except the stone of \n","the floor. \n","\n","very slowly he got up and groped about on \n","all fours, till he touched the wall of the tunnel; but \n","neither up nor down it could he find anything: \n","nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no sign of \n","dwarves. his head was swimming, and he was \n","far from certain even of the direction they had \n","been going in when he had his fall. he guessed \n","as well as he could, and crawled along for a \n","good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt \n","like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of \n","the tunnel. it was a turning point in his career, \n","but he did not know it. he put the ring in his \n","pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did \n","\n","\n","not seem of any particular use at the moment. \n","he did not go much further, but sat down on the \n","cold floor and gave himself up to complete \n","miserableness, for a long while. he thought of \n","himself frying bacon and eggs in his own \n","kitchen at home - for he could feel inside that it \n","was high time for some meal or other; but that \n","only made him miserabler. \n","\n","he could not think what to do; nor could he \n","think what had happened; or why he had been \n","left behind; or why, if he had been left behind, \n","the goblins had not caught him; or even why his \n","head was so sore. the truth was he had been \n","lying quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very \n","dark corner for a long while. \n","\n","after some time he felt for his pipe. it was \n","not broken, and that was something. then he \n","felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco \n","in it, and that was something more. then he felt \n","for matches and he could not find any at all, and \n","that shattered his hopes completely. just as \n","well for him, as he agreed when he came to his \n","senses. goodness knows what the striking of \n","matches and the smell of tobacco would have \n","brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible \n","place. still at the moment he felt very crushed. \n","but in slapping all his pockets and feeling all \n","round himself for matches his hand came on the \n","hilt of his little sword - the little dagger that he \n","\n","\n","\n","got from the trolls, and that he had quite \n","forgotten; nor fortunately had the goblins \n","noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches. \n","\n","now he drew it out. it shone pale and dim \n","before his eyes. \"so it is an elvish blade, too,\" \n","he thought; \"and goblins are not very near, and \n","yet not far enough.\" \n","\n","but somehow he was comforted. it was \n","rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in \n","gondolin for the goblin-wars of which so many \n","songs had sung; and also he had noticed that \n","such weapons made a great impression on \n","goblins that came upon them suddenly. \n","\n","\"go back?\" he thought. \"no good at all! go \n","sideways? impossible! go forward? only thing \n","to do! on we go!\" so up he got, and trotted \n","along with his little sword held in front of him \n","and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all \n","of a patter and a pitter. \n","\n","\n","now certainly bilbo was in what is called a tight \n","place. but you must remember it was not quite \n","so tight for him as it would have been for me or \n","for you. hobbits are not quite like ordinary \n","people; and after all if their holes are nice \n","cheery places and properly aired, quite different \n","from the tunnels of the goblins, still they are \n","\n","\n","\n","more used to tunnelling than we are, and they \n","do not easily lose their sense of direction \n","underground - not when their heads have \n","recovered from being bumped. also they can \n","move very quietly, and hide easily, and recover \n","wonderfully from falls and bruises, and they \n","have a fund of wisdom and wise sayings that \n","men have mostly never heard or have forgotten \n","long ago. \n","\n","i should not have liked to have been in mr. \n","baggins' place, all the same. the tunnel \n","seemed to have no end. all he knew was that it \n","was still going down pretty steadily and keeping \n","in the same direction in spite of a twist and a \n","turn or two. there were passages leading off to \n","the side every now and then, as he knew by the \n","glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand \n","on the wall. of these he took no notice, except \n","to hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined \n","dark things coming out of them. on and on he \n","went, and down and down; and still he heard no \n","sound of anything except the occasional whirr of \n","a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it \n","became too frequent to bother about. i do not \n","know how long he kept on like this, hating to go \n","on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was \n","tireder than tired. it seemed like all the way to \n","tomorrow and over it to the days beyond. \n","\n","suddenly without any warning he trotted \n","\n","\n","\n","splash into water! ugh! it was icy cold. that \n","pulled him up sharp and short. he did not know \n","whether it was just a pool in the path, or the \n","edge of an underground stream that crossed \n","the passage, or the brink of a deep dark \n","subterranean lake. the sword was hardly \n","shining at all. he stopped, and he could hear, \n","when he listened hard, drops drip-drip-dripping \n","from an unseen roof into the water below; but \n","there seemed no other sort of sound. \n","\n","\"so it is a pool or a lake, and not an \n","underground river,\" he thought. still he did not \n","dare to wade out into the darkness. he could \n","not swim; and he thought, too, of nasty slimy \n","things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in \n","the water. there are strange things living in the \n","pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains: fish \n","whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows \n","how many years ago, and never swam out \n","again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger \n","and bigger from trying to see in the blackness; \n","also there are other things more slimy than fish. \n","even in the tunnels and caves the goblins have \n","made for themselves there are other things \n","living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in \n","from outside to lie up in the dark. some of \n","these caves, too, go back in their beginnings to \n","ages before the goblins, who only widened \n","them and joined them up with passages, and \n","\n","\n","\n","the original owners are still there in odd \n","corners, slinking and nosing about. \n","\n","deep down here by the dark water lived old \n","gollum, a small slimy creature. i don't know \n","where he came from, nor who or what he was. \n","he was gollum - as dark as darkness, except \n","for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. he \n","had a little boat, and he rowed about quite \n","quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and \n","deep and deadly cold. he paddled it with large \n","feet dangling over the side, but never a ripple \n","did he make. not he. he was looking out of his \n","pale lamp-like eyes for blind fish, which he \n","grabbed with his long fingers as quick as \n","thinking. he liked meat too. goblin he thought \n","good, when he could get it; but he took care \n","they never found him out. he just throttled them \n","from behind, if they ever came down alone \n","anywhere near the edge of the water, while he \n","was prowling about. they very seldom did, for \n","they had a feeling that something unpleasant \n","was lurking down there, down at the very roots \n","of the mountain. they had come on the lake, \n","when they were tunnelling down long ago, and \n","they found they could go no further; so there \n","their road ended in that direction, and there was \n","no reason to go that way - unless the great \n","goblin sent them. sometimes he took a fancy \n","for fish from the lake, and sometimes neither \n","\n","\n","\n","goblin nor fish came back. \n","\n","actually gollum lived on a slimy island of \n","rock in the middle of the lake. he was watching \n","bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes \n","like telescopes. bilbo could not see him, but he \n","was wondering a lot about bilbo, for he could \n","see that he was no goblin at all. \n","\n","gollum got into his boat and shot off from \n","the island, while bilbo was sitting on the brink \n","altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way \n","and his wits. suddenly up came gollum and \n","whispered and hissed: \n","\n","\"bless us and splash us, my precioussss! i \n","guess it's a choice feast; at least a tasty morsel \n","it'd make us, gollum!\"and when he said gollum \n","he made a horrible swallowing noise in his \n","throat. that is how he got his name, though he \n","always called himself 'my precious'. \n","\n","the hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin \n","when the hiss came in his ears, and he \n","suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him. \n","\n","\"who are you?\" he said, thrusting his \n","dagger in front of him. \n","\n","\"what iss he, my preciouss?\" whispered \n","gollum (who always spoke to himself through \n","never having anyone else to speak to). this is \n","what he had come to find out, for he was not \n","really very hungry at the moment, only curious; \n","otherwise he would have grabbed first and \n","\n","\n","\n","whispered afterwards. \n","\n","\"i am mr. bilbo baggins. i have lost the \n","dwarves and i have lost the wizard, and i don't \n","know where i am; and i don't want to know, if \n","only i can get away.\" \n","\n","\"what's he got in his handses?\" said \n","gollum, looking at the sword, which he did not \n","quite like. \n","\n","\"a sword, a blade which came out of \n","gondolin!\" \n","\n","\"sssss\" said gollum, and became quite \n","polite. \"praps ye sits here and chats with it a \n","bitsy, my preciousss. it likes riddles, praps it \n","does, does it?\" he was anxious to appear \n","friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he \n","found out more about the sword and the hobbit, \n","whether he was quite alone really, whether he \n","was good to eat, and whether gollum was really \n","hungry. riddles were all he could think of. \n","asking them, and sometimes guessing them, \n","had been the only game he had ever played \n","with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in \n","the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends \n","and was driven away, alone, and crept down, \n","down, into the dark under the mountains. \n","\n","\"very well,\" said bilbo, who was anxious to \n","agree, until he found out more about the \n","creature, whether he was quite alone, whether \n","he was fierce or hungry, and whether he was a \n","\n","\n","\n","friend of the goblins. \n","\n","\"you ask first,\" he said, because he had not \n","had time to think of a riddle. \n","\n","so gollum hissed: \n","\n","\n","what has roots as nobody sees, \n","is taller than trees, \n","\n","up, up it goes, \n","\n","and yet never grows? \n","\n","\n","\"easy!\" said bilbo. \"mountain, i suppose.\" \n","\n","\"does it guess easy? it must have a \n","competition with us, my preciouss! if precious \n","asks, and it doesn't answer, we eats it, my \n","preciousss. if it asks us, and we doesn't \n","answer, then we does what it wants, eh? we \n","shows it the way out, yes!\" \n","\n","\"all right!\" said bilbo, not daring to \n","disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to think \n","of riddles that could save him from being eaten. \n","\n","\n","thirty white horses on a red hill, \n","first they champ, \n","\n","then they stamp, \n","\n","then they stand still. \n","\n","\n","\n","that was all he could think of to ask - the \n","idea of eating was rather on his mind. it was \n","rather an old one, too, and gollum knew the \n","answer as well as you do. \n","\n","\"chestnuts, chestnuts,\" he hissed. \"teeth! \n","teeth! my preciousss; but we has only six!\" then \n","he asked his second: \n","\n","\n","voiceless it cries, \n","wingless flutters, \n","toothless bites, \n","mouthless mutters. \n","\n","\n","\"half a moment!\" cried bilbo, who was still \n","thinking uncomfortably about eating. fortunately \n","he had once heard something rather like this \n","before, and getting his wits back he thought of \n","the answer. \"wind, wind of course,\" he said, \n","and he was so pleased that he made up one on \n","the spot. \"this'll puzzle the nasty little \n","underground creature,\" he thought: \n","\n","\n","an eye in a blue face \n","sawan eye in a green face. \n","\"that eye is like to this eye\" \n","said the first eye, \n","\n","\n","\n","\"butin tow place \n","notin high place.\" \n","\n","\n","\"ss, ss, ss,\" said gollum. he had been \n","underground a long long time, and was \n","forgetting this sort of thing. but just as bilbo was \n","beginning to hope that the wretch would not be \n","able to answer, gollum brought up memories of \n","ages and ages and ages before, when he lived \n","with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a \n","river, \"sss, sss, my preciouss,\" he said. \"sun on \n","the daisies it means, it does.\" \n","\n","but these ordinary above ground everyday \n","sort of riddles were tiring for him. also they \n","reminded him of days when he had been less \n","lonely and sneaky and nasty, and that put him \n","out of temper. what is more they made him \n","hungry; so this time he tried something a bit \n","more difficult and more unpleasant: \n","\n","\n","it cannot be seen, cannot be felt, \n","cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. \n","it lies behind stars and underhills, \n","and empty holes it fills. \n","\n","it comes first and follows after, \n","ends life, kills laughter. \n","\n","\n","\n","unfortunately for gollum bilbo had heard \n","that sort of thing before; and the answer was all \n","round him anyway. \"dark!\" he said without even \n","scratching his head or putting on his thinking \n","cap. \n","\n","\n","a box without hinges, key, or lid, \n","yet golden treasure inside is hid, \n","\n","\n","he asked to gain time, until he could think of a \n","really hard one. this he thought a dreadfully \n","easy chestnut, though he had not asked it in the \n","usual words. but it proved a nasty poser for \n","gollum. he hissed to himself, and still he did not \n","answer; he whispered and spluttered. \n","\n","after some while bilbo became impatient. \n","\"well, what is it?\" he said. \"the answer's not a \n","kettle boiling over, as you seem to think from \n","the noise you are making.\" \n","\n","\"give us a chance; let it give us a chance, \n","my preciouss - ss - ss.\" \n","\n","\"well,\" said bilbo after giving him a long \n","chance, \"what about your guess?\" \n","\n","but suddenly gollum remembered thieving \n","from nests long ago, and sitting under the river \n","\n","\n","\n","bank teaching his grandmother, teaching his \n","grandmother to suck - \"eggses!\" he hissed. \n","\"eggses it is!\" then he asked: \n","\n","\n","alive without breath, \n","\n","as cold as death; \n","\n","never thirsty, ever drinking, \n","all in mail never clinking. \n","\n","\n","he also in his turn thought this was a \n","dreadfully easy one, because he was always \n","thinking of the answer. but he could not \n","remember anything better at the moment, he \n","was so flustered by the egg-question. all the \n","same it was a poser for poor bilbo, who never \n","had anything to do with the water if he could \n","help it. i imagine you know the answer, of \n","course, or can guess it as easy as winking, \n","since you are sitting comfortably at home and \n","have not the danger of being eaten to disturb \n","your thinking. bilbo sat and cleared his throat \n","once or twice, but no answer came. \n","\n","after a while gollum began to hiss with \n","pleasure to himself: \"is it nice, my preciousss? \n","is it juicy? is it scrumptiously crunchable?\" he \n","began to peer at bilbo out of the darkness. \n","\n","\"half a moment,\" said the hobbit shivering. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"i gave you a good long chance just now.\" \n","\n","\"it must make haste, haste!\" said gollum, \n","beginning to climb out of his boat on to the \n","shore to get at bilbo. but when he put his long \n","webby foot in the water, a fish jumped out in a \n","fright and fell on bilbo's toes. \n","\n","\"ugh!\" he said, \"it is cold and clammy!\" - \n","and so he guessed. \"fish! fish!\" he cried. \"it is \n","fish!\" \n","\n","gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but \n","bilbo asked another riddle as quick as ever he \n","could, so that gollum had to get back into his \n","boat and think. \n","\n","no-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near \n","on three-legs, four-legs got some. \n","\n","it was not really the right time for this riddle, \n","but bilbo was in a hurry. gollum might have had \n","some trouble guessing it, if he had asked it at \n","another time. as it was, talking offish, \"no-legs\" \n","was not so very difficult, and after that the rest \n","was easy. \"fish on a little table, man at table \n","sitting on a stool, the cat has the bones\" that of \n","course is the answer, and gollum soon gave it. \n","then he thought the time had come to ask \n","something hard and horrible. this is what he \n","said: \n","\n","\n","this thing all things devours: \n","\n","\n","\n","birds, beasts, trees, flowers; \n","gnaws iron, bites steel; \n","\n","grinds hard stones to meal; \n","slays king, ruins town, \n","\n","and beats high mountain down. \n","\n","\n","poor bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the \n","horrible names of all the giants and ogres he \n","had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of \n","them had done all these things. he had a \n","feeling that the answer was quite different and \n","that he ought to know it, but he could not think of \n","it. he began to get frightened, and that is bad \n","for thinking. gollum began to get out of his boat. \n","he flapped into the water and paddled to the \n","bank; bilbo could see his eyes coming towards \n","him. his tongue seemed to stick in his mouth; \n","he wanted to shout out: \"give me more time! \n","give me time!\" but all that came out with a \n","sudden squeal was: \n","\n","\"time! time!\" \n","\n","\n","bilbo was saved by pure luck. for that of \n","course was the answer. \n","\n","gollum was disappointed once more; and \n","now he was getting angry, and also tired of the \n","game. it had made him very hungry indeed. this \n","\n","\n","\n","time he did not go back to the boat. he sat \n","down in the dark by bilbo. that made the hobbit \n","most dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered \n","his wits. \n","\n","\"it's got to ask uss a quesstion, my \n","preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. jusst one more \n","question to guess, yes, yess,\" said gollum. \n","\n","but bilbo simply could not think of any \n","question with that nasty wet cold thing sitting \n","next to him, and pawing and poking him. he \n","scratched himself, he pinched himself; still he \n","could not think of anything. \n","\n","\"ask us! ask us!\" said gollum. \n","\n","bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; \n","he gripped on his little sword; he even felt in his \n","pocket with his other hand. there he found the \n","ring he had picked up in the passage and \n","forgotten about. \n","\n","\"what have i got in my pocket?\" he said \n","aloud. he was talking to himself, but gollum \n","thought it was a riddle, and he was frightfully \n","upset. \n","\n","\"not fair! not fair!\" he hissed. \"it isn't fair, my \n","precious, is it, to ask us what it's got in its \n","nassty little pocketses?\" \n","\n","bilbo seeing what had happened and \n","having nothing better to ask stuck to his \n","question, \"what have i got in my pocket?\" he \n","said louder. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"s-s-s-s-s,\" hissed gollum. \"it must give us \n","three guesseses, my preciouss, three \n","guesseses.\" \n","\n","\"very well! guess away!\" said bilbo. \n","\n","\"handses!\" said gollum. \n","\n","\"wrong,\" said bilbo, who had luckily just \n","taken his hand out again. \"guess again!\" \n","\n","\"s-s-s-s-s,\" said gollum more upset than \n","ever. he thought of all the things he kept in his \n","own pockets: fish-bones, goblins' teeth, wet \n","shells, a bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to \n","sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. \n","he tried to think what other people kept in their \n","pockets. \n","\n","\"knife!\" he said at last. \n","\n","\"wrong!\" said bilbo, who had lost his some \n","time ago. \"last guess!\" \n","\n","now gollum was in a much worse state \n","than when bilbo had asked him the egg- \n","question. he hissed and spluttered and rocked \n","himself backwards and forwards, and slapped \n","his feet on the floor, and wriggled and \n","squirmed; but still he did not dare to waste his \n","last guess. \n","\n","\"come on!\" said bilbo. \"i am waiting!\" he \n","tried to sound bold and cheerful, but he did not \n","feel at all sure how the game was going to end, \n","whether gollum guessed right or not. \n","\n","\"time's up!\" he said. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"string, or nothing!\" shrieked gollum, which \n","was not quite fair - working in two guesses at \n","once. \n","\n","\"both wrong,\" cried bilbo very much \n","relieved; and he jumped at once to his feet, put \n","his back to the nearest wall, and held out his \n","little sword. he knew, of course, that the riddle- \n","game was sacred and of immense antiquity, \n","and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat \n","when they played at it. but he felt he could not \n","trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a \n","pinch. any excuse would do for him to slide out \n","of it. and after all that last question had not \n","been a genuine riddle according to the ancient \n","laws. \n","\n","but at any rate gollum did not at once \n","attack him. he could see the sword in bilbo's \n","hand. he sat still, shivering and whispering. at \n","last bilbo could wait no longer. \n","\n","\"well?\" he said. \"what about your promise? \n","i want to go. you must show me the way.\" \n","\n","\"did we say so, precious? show the nassty \n","little baggins the way out, yes, yes. but what \n","has it got in its pocketses, eh? not string, \n","precious, but not nothing. oh no! gollum!\" \n","\n","\"never you mind,\" said bilbo. \"a promise is \n","a promise.\" \n","\n","\"cross it is, impatient, precious,\" hissed \n","gollum. \"but it must wait, yes it must. we can't \n","\n","\n","\n","go up the tunnels so hasty. we must go and get \n","some things first, yes, things to help us.\" \n","\n","\"well, hurry up!\" said bilbo, relieved to think \n","of gollum going away. he thought he was just \n","making an excuse and did not mean to come \n","back. what was gollum talking about? what \n","useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake? \n","but he was wrong. gollum did mean to come \n","back. he was angry now and hungry. and he \n","was a miserable wicked creature, and already \n","he had a plan. \n","\n","not far away was his island, of which bilbo \n","knew nothing, and there in his hiding-place he \n","kept a few wretched oddments, and one very \n","beautiful thing, very beautiful, very wonderful. he \n","had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring. \n","\n","\"my birthday-present!\" he whispered to \n","himself, as he had often done in the endless \n","dark days. \"that's what we wants now, yes; we \n","wants it!\" \n","\n","he wanted it because it was a ring of \n","power, and if you slipped that ring on your \n","finger, you were invisible; only in the full sunlight \n","could you be seen, and then only by your \n","shadow, and that would be shaky and faint. \n","\n","\"my birthday-present! it came to me on my \n","birthday, my precious.\" so he had always said \n","to himself. but who knows how gollum came by \n","that present, ages ago in the old days when \n","\n","\n","\n","such rings were still at large in the world? \n","perhaps even the master who ruled them could \n","not have said. gollum used to wear it at first, till \n","it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next \n","his skin, till it galled him; and now usually he hid \n","it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was \n","always going back to look at it. and still \n","sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear \n","to be parted from it any longer, or when he was \n","very, very, hungry, and tired of fish. then he \n","would creep along dark passages looking for \n","stray goblins. he might even venture into places \n","where the torches were lit and made his eyes \n","blink and smart; for he would be safe. oh yes, \n","quite safe. no one would see him, no one would \n","notice him, till he had his fingers on their throat. \n","only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught \n","a small goblin-imp. how it squeaked! he still \n","had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted \n","something softer. \n","\n","\"quite safe, yes,\" he whispered to himself. \n","\"it won't see us, will it, my precious? no. it won't \n","see us, and its nassty little sword will be \n","useless, yes quite.\" \n","\n","that is what was in his wicked little mind, as \n","he slipped suddenly from bilbo's side, and \n","flapped back to his boat, and went off into the \n","dark. bilbo thought he had heard the last of him. \n","still he waited a while; for he had no idea how \n","\n","\n","\n","to find his way out alone. \n","\n","suddenly he heard a screech. it sent a \n","shiver down his back. gollum was cursing and \n","wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the \n","sound of it. he was on his island, scrabbling \n","here and there, searching and seeking in vain. \n","\n","\"where iss it? where iss it?\" bilbo heard \n","him crying. \"losst it is, my precious, lost, lost! \n","curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!\" \n","\n","\"what's the matter?\" bilbo called. \"what \n","have you lost?\" \n","\n","\"it mustn't ask us,\" shrieked gollum. \"not its \n","business, no, gollum! it's losst, gollum, gollum, \n","gollum.\" \n","\n","\"well, so am i,\" cried bilbo, \"and i want to \n","get unlost. and i won the game, and you \n","promised. so come along! come and let me \n","out, and then go on with your looking!\" utterly \n","miserable as gollum sounded, bilbo could not \n","find much pity in his heart, and he had a feeling \n","that anything gollum wanted so much could \n","hardly be something good. \"come along!\" he \n","shouted. \n","\n","\"no, not yet, precious!\" gollum answered. \n","\"we must search for it, it's lost, gollum.\" \n","\n","\"but you never guessed my last question, \n","and you promised,\" said bilbo. \n","\n","\"never guessed!\" said gollum. then \n","suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp hiss. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"what has it got in its pocketses? tell us that. it \n","must tell first.\" \n","\n","as far as bilbo knew, there was no \n","particular reason why he should not tell. \n","gollum's mind had jumped to a guess quicker \n","than his; naturally, for gollum had brooded for \n","ages on this one thing, and he was always \n","afraid of its being stolen. but bilbo was \n","annoyed at the delay. after all, he had won the \n","game, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. \"answers \n","were to be guessed not given,\" he said. \n","\n","\"but it wasn't a fair question,\" said gollum. \n","\"not a riddle, precious, no.\" \n","\n","\"oh well, if it's a matter of ordinary \n","questions,\" bilbo replied, \"then i asked one first. \n","what have you lost? tell me that!\" \n","\n","\"what has it got in its pocketses?\" the \n","sound came hissing louder and sharper, and as \n","he looked towards it, to his alarm bilbo now \n","saw two small points of light peering at him. as \n","suspicion grew in gollum's mind, the light of his \n","eyes burned with a pale flame. \n","\n","\"what have you lost?\" bilbo persisted. \n","\n","but now the light in gollum's eyes had \n","become a green fire, and it was coming swiftly \n","nearer. gollum was in his boat again, paddling \n","wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage \n","of loss and suspicion was in his heart that no \n","sword had any more terror for him. \n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo could not guess what had maddened \n","the wretched creature, but he saw that all was \n","up, and that gollum meant to murder him at any \n","rate. just in time he turned and ran blindly back \n","up the dark passage down which he had come, \n","keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his \n","left hand. \n","\n","\"what has it got in its pocketses?\" he heard \n","the hiss loud behind him, and the splash as \n","gollum leapt from his boat. \"what have i, i \n","wonder?\" he said to himself, as he panted and \n","stumbled along. he put his left hand in his \n","pocket. the ring felt very cold as it quietly \n","slipped on to his groping forefinger. \n","\n","the hiss was close behind him. he turned \n","now and saw gollum's eyes like small green \n","lamps coming up the slope. terrified he tried to \n","run faster, but suddenly he struck his toes on a \n","snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little sword \n","under him. \n","\n","in a moment gollum was on him. but before \n","bilbo could do anything, recover his breath, \n","pick himself up, or wave his sword, gollum \n","passed by, taking no notice of him, cursing and \n","whispering as he ran. \n","\n","what could it mean? gollum could see in \n","the dark. bilbo could see the light of his eyes \n","palely shining even from behind. painfully he got \n","up, and sheathed his sword, which was now \n","\n","\n","\n","glowing faintly again, then very cautiously he \n","followed. there seemed nothing else to do. it \n","was no good crawling back down to gollum's \n","water. perhaps if he followed him, gollum might \n","lead him to some way of escape without \n","meaning to. \n","\n","\"curse it! curse it! curse it!\" hissed gollum. \n","\"curse the baggins! it's gone! what has it got \n","in its pocketses? oh we guess, we guess, my \n","precious. he's found it, yes he must have. my \n","birthday-present.\" \n","\n","bilbo pricked up his ears. he was at last \n","beginning to guess himself. he hurried a little, \n","getting as close as he dared behind gollum, \n","who was still going quickly, not looking back, \n","but turning his head from side to side, as bilbo \n","could see from the faint glimmer on the walls. \n","\n","\"my birthday-present! curse it! how did we \n","lose it, my precious? yes, that's it. when we \n","came this way last, when we twisted that nassty \n","young squeaker. that's it. curse it! it slipped \n","from us, after all these ages and ages! it's \n","gone, gollum.\" \n","\n","suddenly gollum sat down and began to \n","weep, a whistling and gurgling sound horrible to \n","listen to. bilbo halted and flattened himself \n","against the tunnel-wall. after a while gollum \n","stopped weeping and began to talk. he \n","seemed to be having an argument with himself. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"it's no good going back there to search, \n","no. we doesn't remember all the places we've \n","visited. and it's no use. the baggins has got it \n","in its pocketses; the nassty noser has found it, \n","we says.\" \n","\n","\"we guesses, precious, only guesses. we \n","can't know till we find the nassty creature and \n","squeezes it. but it doesn't know what the \n","present can do, does it? it'll just keep it in its \n","pocketses. it doesn't know, and it can't go far. \n","it's lost itself, the nassty nosey thing. it doesn't \n","know the way out. it said so.\" \n","\n","\"it said so, yes; but it's tricksy. it doesn't say \n","what it means. it won't say what it's got in its \n","pocketses. it knows. it knows a way in, it must \n","know a way out, yes. it's off to the back-door. to \n","the back-door, that's it.\" \n","\n","\"the goblinses will catch it then. it can't get \n","out that way, precious.\" \n","\n","\"ssss, sss, gollum! goblinses! yes, but if \n","it's got the present, our precious present, then \n","goblinses will get it, gollum! they'll find it, they'll \n","find out what it does. we shan't ever be safe \n","again, never, gollum! one of the goblinses will \n","put it on, and then no one will see him. he'll be \n","there but not seen. not even our clever eyeses \n","will notice him; and he'll come creepsy and \n","tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!\" \n","\n","\"then let's stop talking, precious, and make \n","\n","\n","\n","haste, tf the baggins has gone that way, we \n","must go quick and see. go! not far now. make \n","haste!\" \n","\n","with a spring gollum got up and started \n","shambling off at a great pace. bilbo hurried \n","after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear \n","now was of tripping on another snag and falling \n","with a noise. his head was in a whirl of hope \n","and wonder. it seemed that the ring he had was \n","a magic ring: it made you invisible! he had \n","heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; \n","but it was hard to believe that he really had \n","found one, by accident. still there it was: gollum \n","with his bright eyes had passed him by, only a \n","yard to one side. \n","\n","on they went, gollum flip-flapping ahead, \n","hissing and cursing; bilbo behind going as \n","softly as a hobbit can. soon they came to \n","places where, as bilbo had noticed on the way \n","down, side-passages opened, this way and \n","that. gollum began at once to count them. \n","\n","\"one left, yes. one right, yes. two right, yes, \n","yes. two left, yes, yes.\" and so on and on. \n","\n","as the count grew he slowed down, and he \n","began to get shaky and weepy; for he was \n","leaving the water further and further behind, and \n","he was getting afraid. goblins might be about, \n","and he had lost his ring. at last he stopped by a \n","low opening, on their left as they went up. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"seven right, yes. six left, yes!\" he \n","whispered. \"this is it. this is the way to the \n","back-door, yes. here's the passage!\" \n","\n","he peered in, and shrank back. \"but we \n","dursn't go in, precious, no we dursn't. \n","goblinses down there. lots of goblinses. we \n","smells them. ssss!\" \n","\n","\"what shall we do? curse them and crush \n","them! we must wait here, precious, wait a bit \n","and see.\" \n","\n","so they came to a dead stop. gollum had \n","brought bilbo to the way out after all, but bilbo \n","could not get in! there was gollum sitting \n","humped up right in the opening, and his eyes \n","gleamed cold in his head, as he swayed it from \n","side to side between his knees. \n","\n","bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly \n","than a mouse; but gollum stiffened at once, and \n","sniffed, and his eyes went green. he hissed \n","softly but menacingly. he could not see the \n","hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and he had \n","other senses that the darkness had sharpened: \n","hearing and smell. he seemed to be crouched \n","right down with his flat hands splayed on the \n","floor, and his head thrust out, nose almost to the \n","stone. though he was only a black shadow in \n","the gleam of his own eyes, bilbo could see or \n","feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered \n","for a spring. \n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo almost stopped breathing, and went \n","stiff himself. he was desperate. he must get \n","away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had \n","any strength left. he must fight. he must stab \n","the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. it meant to \n","kill him. no, not a fair fight. he was invisible \n","now. gollum had no sword. gollum had not \n","actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. \n","and he was miserable, alone, lost. a sudden \n","understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled \n","up in bilbo's heart: a glimpse of endless \n","unmarked days without light or hope of \n","betterment, hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and \n","whispering. all these thoughts passed in a flash \n","of a second. he trembled. and then quite \n","suddenly in another flash, as if lifted by a new \n","strength and resolve, he leaped. \n","\n","no great leap for a man, but a leap in the \n","dark. straight over gollum's head he jumped, \n","seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed, \n","had he known it, he only just missed cracking \n","his skull on the low arch of the passage. \n","\n","gollum threw himself backwards, and \n","grabbed as the hobbit flew over him, but too \n","late: his hands snapped on thin air, and bilbo, \n","falling fair on his sturdy feet, sped off down the \n","new tunnel. he did not turn to see what gollum \n","was doing. there was a hissing and cursing \n","almost at his heels at first, then it stopped. all at \n","\n","\n","\n","once there came a blood-curdling shriek, filled \n","with hatred and despair. gollum was defeated. \n","he dared go no further. he had lost: lost his \n","prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever \n","cared for, his precious. the cry brought bilbo's \n","heart to his mouth, but still he held on. now faint \n","as an echo, but menacing, the voice came \n","behind: \n","\n","\"thief, thief, thief! bag gins! we hates it, we \n","hates it, we hates it for ever!\" \n","\n","then there was a silence. but that too \n","seemed menacing to bilbo. \"if goblins are so \n","near that he smelt them,\" he thought, \"then they'll \n","have heard his shrieking and cursing. careful \n","now, or this way will lead you to worse things.\" \n","\n","the passage was low and roughly made. it \n","was not too difficult for the hobbit, except when, \n","in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes \n","again, several times, on nasty jagged stones in \n","the floor. \"a bit low for goblins, at least for the \n","big ones,\" thought bilbo, not knowing that even \n","the big ones, the ores of the mountains, go \n","along at a great speed stooping low with their \n","hands almost on the ground. \n","\n","soon the passage that had been sloping \n","down began to go up again, and after a while it \n","climbed steeply. that slowed bilbo down. but at \n","last the slope stopped, the passage turned a \n","corner and dipped down again, and there, at \n","\n","\n","\n","the bottom of a short incline, he saw, filtering \n","round another corner - a glimpse of light. not \n","red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-of- \n","doors sort of light. then bilbo began to run. \n","\n","scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him \n","he turned the last corner and came suddenly \n","right into an open space, where the light, after \n","all that time in the dark, seemed dazzlingly \n","bright. really it was only a leak of sunshine in \n","through a doorway, where a great door, a stone \n","door, was left standing open. \n","\n","bilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the \n","goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn \n","swords sitting just inside the door, and watching \n","it with wide eyes, and watching the passage \n","that led to it. they were aroused, alert, ready for \n","anything. \n","\n","they saw him sooner than he saw them. \n","yes, they saw him. whether it was an accident, \n","or a last trick of the ring before it took a new \n","master, it was not on his finger. with yells of \n","delight the goblins rushed upon him. \n","\n","a pang of fear and loss, like an echo of \n","gollum's misery, smote bilbo, and forgetting \n","even to draw his sword he struck his hands into \n","his pockets. and there was the ring still, in his \n","left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. the \n","goblins stopped short. they could not see a \n","sign of him. he had vanished. they yelled twice \n","\n","\n","\n","as loud as before, but not so delightedly. \n","\n","\"where is it?\" they cried. \n","\n","\"go back up the passage!\" some shouted. \n","\n","\"this way!\" some yelled. \"that way!\" others \n","yelled. \n","\n","\"look out for the door,\" bellowed the \n","captain. \n","\n","whistles blew, armour clashed, swords \n","rattled, goblins cursed and swore and ran hither \n","and thither, falling over one another and getting \n","very angry. there was a terrible outcry, to-do, \n","and disturbance. \n","\n","bilbo was dreadfully frightened, but he had \n","the sense to understand what had happened \n","and to sneak behind a big barrel which held \n","drink for the goblin-guards, and so get out of the \n","way and avoid being bumped into, trampled to \n","death, or caught by feel. \n","\n","\"i must get to the door, i must get to the \n","door!\" he kept on saying to himself, but it was a \n","long time before he ventured to try. then it was \n","like a horrible game of blind-man's-buff. the \n","place was full of goblins running about, and the \n","poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was \n","knocked over by a goblin who could not make \n","out what he had bumped into, scrambled away \n","on all fours, slipped between the legs of the \n","captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door. \n","\n","it was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it \n","\n","\n","\n","nearly to. bilbo struggled but he could not move \n","it. he tried to squeeze through the crack. he \n","squeezed and squeezed, and he stuck! it was \n","awful. his buttons had got wedged on the edge \n","of the door and the door-post. he could see \n","outside into the open air: there were a few \n","steps running down into a narrow valley \n","between tall mountains; the sun came out from \n","behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside \n","of the door - but he could not get through. \n","\n","suddenly one of the goblins inside shouted: \n","\"there is a shadow by the door. something is \n","outside!\" \n","\n","bilbo's heart jumped into his mouth. he \n","gave a terrific squirm. buttons burst off in all \n","directions. he was through, with a torn coat and \n","waistcoat, leaping down the steps like a goat, \n","while bewildered goblins were still picking up \n","his nice brass buttons on the doorstep. \n","\n","of course they soon came down after him, \n","hooting and hallooing, and hunting among the \n","trees. but they don't like the sun: it makes their \n","legs wobble and their heads giddy. they could \n","not find bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and \n","out of the shadow of the trees, running quick \n","and quiet, and keeping out of the sun; so soon \n","they went back grumbling and cursing to guard \n","the door. bilbo had escaped. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter vi \n","\n","\n","out of the frying-pan into \n","\n","the fire \n","\n","\n","bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not \n","know where he was. he had lost hood, cloak, \n","food, pony, his buttons and his friends. he \n","wandered on and on, till the sun began to sink \n","westwards - behind the mountains. their \n","shadows fell across bilbo's path, and he looked \n","back. then he looked forward and could see \n","before him only ridges and slopes falling \n","towards lowlands and plains glimpsed \n","occasionally between the trees. \n","\n","\"good heavens!\" he exclaimed. \"i seem to \n","have got right to the other side of the misty \n","mountains, right to the edge of the land \n","beyond! where and o where can gandalf and \n","the dwarves have got to? i only hope to \n","goodness they are not still back there in the \n","power of the goblins!\" \n","\n","he still wandered on, out of the little high \n","valley, over its edge, and down the slopes \n","beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable \n","\n","\n","thought was growing inside him. he wondered \n","whether he ought not, now he had the magic \n","ring, to go back into the horrible, horrible, \n","tunnels and look for his friends. he had just \n","made up his mind that it was his duty, that he \n","must turn back - and very miserable he felt \n","about it - when he heard voices. \n","\n","he stopped and listened. it did not sound \n","like goblins; so he crept forward carefully. he \n","was on a stony path winding downwards with a \n","rocky wall on the left hand; on the other side the \n","ground sloped away and there were dells below \n","the level of the path overhung with bushes and \n","low trees. in one of these dells under the bushes \n","people were talking. \n","\n","he crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw \n","peering between two big boulders a head with \n","a red hood on: it was balin doing look-out. he \n","could have clapped and shouted for joy, but he \n","did not. he had still got the ring on, for fear of \n","meeting something unexpected and \n","unpleasant, and he saw that balin was looking \n","straight at him without noticing him. \n","\n","\"i will give them all a surprise,\" he thought, \n","as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of the \n","dell. gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. \n","they were discussing all that had happened to \n","them in the tunnels, and wondering and \n","debating what they were to do now. the \n","dwarves were grumbling, and gandalf was \n","saying that they could not possibly go on with \n","\n","\n","\n","their journey leaving mr. baggins in the hands of \n","the goblins, without trying to find out if he was \n","alive or dead, and without trying to rescue him. \n","\n","\"after all he is my friend,\" said the wizard, \n","\"and not a bad little chap. i feel responsible for \n","him. i wish to goodness you had not lost him.\" \n","\n","the dwarves wanted to know why he had \n","ever been brought at all, why he could not stick \n","to his friends and come along with them, and \n","why the wizard had not chosen someone with \n","more sense. \"he has been more trouble than \n","use so far,\" said one. \"if we have got to go back \n","now into those abominable tunnels to look for \n","him, then drat him, i say.\" \n","\n","gandalf answered angrily: \"i brought him, \n","and i don't bring things that are of no use. either \n","you help me to look for him, or i go and leave \n","you here to get out of the mess as best you can \n","yourselves. if we can only find him again, you \n","will thank me before all is over. whatever did \n","you want to go and drop him for, dori?\" \n","\n","\"you would have dropped him,\" said dori, \n","\"if a goblin had suddenly grabbed your legs \n","from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, \n","and kicked you in the back!\" \n","\n","\"then why didn't you pick him up again?\" \n","\n","\"good heavens! can you ask! goblins \n","fighting and biting in the dark, everybody falling \n","over bodies and hitting one another! you nearly \n","chopped off my head with glamdring, and \n","thorin was stabbing here there and everywhere \n","\n","\n","\n","with orcrist. all of a sudden you gave one of \n","your blinding flashes, and we saw the goblins \n","running back yelping. you shouted 'follow me \n","everybody!' and everybody ought to have \n","followed. we thought everybody had. there was \n","no time to count, as you know quite well, till we \n","had dashed through the gate-guards, out of the \n","lower door, and helter-skelter down here. and \n","here we are - without the burglar, confusticate \n","him!\" \n","\n","\"and here's the burglar!\" said bilbo \n","stepping down into the middle of them, and \n","slipping off the ring. \n","\n","bless me, how they jumped! then they \n","shouted with surprise and delight. gandalf was \n","as astonished as any of them, but probably \n","more pleased than all the others. he called to \n","balin and told him what he thought of a look-out \n","man who let people walk right into them like that \n","without warning. it is a fact that bilbo's \n","reputation went up a very great deal with the \n","dwarves after this. if they had still doubted that \n","he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of \n","gandalf s words, they doubted no longer. balin \n","was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it \n","was a very clever bit of work. \n","\n","indeed bilbo was so pleased with their \n","praise that he just chuckled inside and said \n","nothing whatever about the ring; and when they \n","asked him how he did it, he said: \"oh, just crept \n","along, you know - very carefully and quietly.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"well, it is the first time that even a mouse \n","has crept along carefully and quietly under my \n","very nose and not been spotted,\" said balin, \n","\"and i take off my hood to you.\" which he did. \n","\n","\"balin at your service,\" said he. \n","\n","\"your servant, mr. baggins,\" said bilbo. \n","\n","then they wanted to know all about his \n","adventures after they had lost him, and he sat \n","down and told them everything - except about \n","the finding of the ring (\"not just now\" he thought). \n","they were particularly interested in the riddle- \n","competition, and shuddered most \n","appreciatively at his description of gollum. \n","\n","\"and then i couldn't think of any other \n","question with him sitting beside me,\" ended \n","bilbo; \"so i said 'what's in my pocket?' and he \n","couldn't guess in three goes. so i said: 'what \n","about your promise? show me the way out!' but \n","he came at me to kill me, and i ran, and fell \n","over, and he missed me in the dark. then i \n","followed him, because i heard him talking to \n","himself. he thought i really knew the way out, \n","and so he was making for it. and then he sat \n","down in the entrance, and i could not get by. so \n","i jumped over him and escaped, and ran down \n","to the gate.\" \n","\n","\"what about the guards?\" they asked. \n","\"weren't there any?\" \n","\n","\"o yes! lots of them; but i dodged 'em. i got \n","stuck in the door, which was only open a crack, \n","and i lost lots of buttons,\" he said sadly looking \n","\n","\n","\n","at his torn clothes. \"but i squeezed through all \n","right - and here lam.\" \n","\n","the dwarves looked at him with quite a new \n","respect, when he talked about dodging guards, \n","jumping over gollum, and squeezing through, \n","as if it was not very difficult or very alarming. \n","\n","\"what did i tell you?\" said gandalf laughing. \n","\"mr. baggins has more about him than you \n","guess.\" he gave bilbo a queer look from under \n","his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and the \n","hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his \n","tale that he had left out. \n","\n","then he had questions of his own to ask, for \n","if gandalf had explained it all by now to the \n","dwarves, bilbo had not heard it. he wanted to \n","know how the wizard had turned up again, and \n","where they had all got to now. \n","\n","the wizard, to tell the truth, never minded \n","explaining his cleverness more than once, so \n","now he told bilbo that both he and elrond had \n","been well aware of the presence of evil goblins \n","in that part of the mountains. but their main gate \n","used to come out on a different pass, one more \n","easy to travel by, so that they often caught \n","people benighted near their gates. evidently \n","people had given up going that way, and the \n","goblins must have opened their new entrance at \n","the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite \n","recently, because it had been found quite safe \n","up to now. \n","\n","\"i must see if i can't find a more or less \n","\n","\n","\n","decent giant to block it up again,\" said gandalf, \n","''or soon there will be no getting over the \n","mountains at all.\" \n","\n","as soon as gandalf had heard bilbo's yell \n","he realized what had happened. in the flash \n","which killed the goblins that were grabbing him \n","he had nipped inside the crack, just as it \n","snapped to. he followed after the drivers and \n","prisoners right to the edge of the great hall, and \n","there he sat down and worked up the best \n","magic he could in the shadows. \n","\n","\"a very ticklish business, it was,\" he said. \n","''touch and go!\" \n","\n","but, of course, gandalf had made a special \n","study of bewitchments with fire and lights (even \n","the hobbit had never forgotten the magic \n","fireworks at old took's midsummer-eve \n","parties, as you remember). the rest we all \n","know - except that gandalf knew all about the \n","back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate, \n","where bilbo lost his buttons. as a matter of fact \n","it was well known to anybody who was \n","acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it \n","took a wizard to keep his head in the tunnels \n","and guide them in the right direction. \n","\n","\"they made that gate ages ago,\" he said, \n","\"partly for a way of escape, if they needed one; \n","partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where \n","they still come in the dark and do great \n","damage. they guard it always and no one has \n","ever managed to block it up. they will guard it \n","\n","\n","\n","doubly after this,\" he laughed. \n","\n","all the others laughed too. after all they had \n","lost a good deal, but they had killed the great \n","goblin and a great many others besides, and \n","they had all escaped, so they might be said to \n","have had the best of it so far. \n","\n","but the wizard called them to their senses. \n","''we must be getting on at once, now we are a \n","little rested,\" he said. \"they will be out after us in \n","hundreds when night comes on; and already \n","shadows are lengthening. they can smell our \n","footsteps for hours and hours after we have \n","passed. we must be miles on before dusk. \n","there will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and \n","that is lucky. not that they mind the moon much, \n","but it will give us a little light to steer by.\" \n","\n","\"o yes!\" he said in answer to more \n","questions from the hobbit. \"you lose track of \n","time inside goblin-tunnels. today's thursday, \n","and it was monday night or tuesday morning \n","that we were captured. we have gone miles \n","and miles, and come right down through the \n","heart of the mountains, and are now on the \n","other side - quite a short cut. but we are not at \n","the point to which our pass would have brought \n","us; we are too far to the north, and have some \n","awkward country ahead. and we are still pretty \n","high up. let's get on!\" \n","\n","\"i am dreadfully hungry,\" groaned bilbo, who \n","was suddenly aware that he had not had a meal \n","since the night before the night before last. just \n","\n","\n","\n","think of that for a hobbit! his stomach felt all \n","empty and loose and his legs all wobbly, now \n","that the excitement was over. \n","\n","\"can't help it,'' said gandalf, \"unless you like \n","to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let you \n","have your pony back and your luggage.\" \n","\n","\"no thank you!\" said bilbo. \n","\n","\"very well then, we must just tighten our \n","belts and trudge on - or we shall be made into \n","supper, and that will be much worse than having \n","none ourselves.\" \n","\n","as they went on bilbo looked from side to \n","side for something to eat; but the blackberries \n","were still only in flower, and of course there \n","were no nuts, not even hawthorn-berries. he \n","nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a \n","small mountain-stream that crossed the path, \n","and he ate three wild strawberries that he found \n","on its bank, but it was not much good. \n","\n","they still went on and on. the rough path \n","disappeared. the bushes, and the long \n","grasses between the boulders, the patches of \n","rabbit-cropped turf, the thyme and the sage and \n","the marjoram, and the yellow rockroses all \n","vanished, and they found themselves at the top \n","of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the \n","remains of a landslide. when they began to go \n","down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled \n","away from their feet; soon larger bits of split \n","stone went clattering down and started other \n","pieces below them slithering and rolling; then \n","\n","\n","\n","lumps of rock were disturbed and bounded off, \n","crashing down with a dust and a noise. before \n","long the whole slope above them and below \n","them seemed on the move, and they were \n","sliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful \n","confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking slabs \n","and stones. \n","\n","it was the trees at the bottom that saved \n","them. they slid into the edge of a climbing \n","wood of pines that here stood right up the \n","mountain slope from the deeper darker forests \n","of the valleys below. some caught hold of the \n","trunks and swung themselves into lower \n","branches, some (like the little hobbit) got \n","behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of \n","the rocks. soon the danger was over, the slide \n","had stopped, and the last faint crashes could \n","be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones \n","went bounding and spinning among the \n","bracken and the pine-roots far below. \n","\n","\"well! that has got us on a bit,\" said \n","gandalf; \"and even goblins tracking us will have \n","a job to come down here quietly.\" \n","\n","\"i daresay,\" grumbled bombur; \"but they \n","won't find it difficult to send stones bouncing \n","down on our heads.\" the dwarves (and bilbo) \n","were feeling far from happy, and were rubbing \n","their bruised and damaged legs and feet. \n","\n","\"nonsense! we are going to turn aside \n","here out of the path of the slide. we must be \n","quick! look at the light!\" \n","\n","\n","\n","the sun had long gone behind the \n","mountains. already the shadows were \n","deepening about them, though far away through \n","the trees and over the black tops of those \n","growing lower down they could still see the \n","evening lights on the plains beyond. they \n","limped along now as fast as they were able \n","down the gentle slopes of a pine forest in a \n","slanting path leading steadily southwards. at \n","times they were pushing through a sea of \n","bracken with tall fronds rising right above the \n","hobbit's head; at times they were marching \n","along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine- \n","needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got \n","heavier and the forest-silence deeper. there \n","was no wind that evening to bring even a sea- \n","sighing into the branches of the trees. \n","\n","\n","\"must we go any further?\" asked bilbo, when it \n","was so dark that he could only just see thorin's \n","beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he \n","could hear the dwarves' breathing like a loud \n","noise. \"my toes are all bruised and bent, and \n","my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like \n","an empty sack.\" \n","\n","\"a bit further,\" said gandalf. \n","\n","after what seemed ages further they came \n","suddenly to an opening where no trees grew. \n","the moon was up and was shining into the \n","clearing. somehow it struck all of them as not at \n","\n","\n","\n","all a nice place, although there was nothing \n","wrong to see. \n","\n","all of a sudden they heard a howl away \n","down hill, a long shuddering howl. it was \n","answered by another away to the right and a \n","good deal nearer to them; then by another not \n","far away to the left. it was wolves howling at the \n","moon, wolves gathering together! \n","\n","there were no wolves living near mr. \n","baggins' hole at home, but he knew that noise. \n","he had had it described to him often enough in \n","tales. one of his elder cousins (on the took \n","side), who had been a great traveller, used to \n","imitate it to frighten him. to hear it out in the \n","forest under the moon was too much for bilbo. \n","even magic rings are not much use against \n","wolves - especially against the evil packs that \n","lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested \n","mountains, over the edge of the wild on the \n","borders of the unknown. wolves of that sort \n","smell keener than goblins, and do not need to \n","see you to catch you! \n","\n","\"what shall we do, what shall we do!\" he \n","cried. \"escaping goblins to be caught by \n","wolves!\" he said, and it became a proverb, \n","though we now say \"out of the frying-pan into the \n","fire\" in the same sort of uncomfortable \n","situations. \n","\n","\"up the trees quick!\" cried gandalf; and \n","they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, \n","hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or \n","\n","\n","\n","were slender enough to swarm up. they found \n","them as quick as ever they could, you can \n","guess; and up they went as high as ever they \n","could trust the branches. you would have \n","laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen \n","the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their \n","beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone \n","cracked and playing at being boys. fili and kili \n","were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous \n","christmas tree. dori, nori, ori, oin, and gloin \n","were more comfortable in a huge pine with \n","regular branches sticking out at intervals like \n","the spokes of a wheel. bifur, bofur, bombur, \n","and thorin were in another. dwalin and balin \n","had swarmed up a tall slender fir with few \n","branches and were trying to find a place to sit in \n","the greenery of the topmost boughs. gandalf, \n","who was a good deal taller than the others, had \n","found a tree into which they could not climb, a \n","large pine standing at the very edge of the \n","glade. he was quite hidden in its boughs, but \n","you could see his eyes gleaming in the moon \n","as he peeped out. \n","\n","and bilbo? he could not get into any tree, \n","and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like \n","a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog \n","after it. \n","\n","\"you've left the burglar behind again!'' said \n","nori to dori looking down. \n","\n","\"i can't be always carrying burglars on my \n","back,\" said dori, \"down tunnels and up trees! \n","\n","\n","\n","what do you think i am? a porter?\" \n","\n","\"he'll be eaten if we don't do something,\" \n","said thorin, for there were howls all round them \n","now, getting nearer and nearer. \"dori!\" he \n","called, for dori was lowest down in the easiest \n","tree, \"be quick, and give mr. baggins a hand \n","up!\" \n","\n","dori was really a decent fellow in spite of \n","his grumbling. poor bilbo could not reach his \n","hand even when he climbed down to the bottom \n","branch and hung his arm down as far as ever \n","he could. so dori actually climbed out of the \n","tree and let bilbo scramble up and stand on his \n","back. \n","\n","just at that moment the wolves trotted \n","howling into the clearing. all of a sudden there \n","were hundreds of eyes looking at them. still \n","dori did not let bilbo down. he waited till he \n","had clambered off his shoulders into the \n","branches, and then he jumped for the branches \n","himself. only just in time! a wolf snapped at his \n","cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. in a \n","minute there was a whole pack of them yelping \n","all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk, \n","with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out. \n","\n","but even the wild wargs (for so the evil \n","wolves over the edge of the wild were named) \n","cannot climb trees. for a time they were safe. \n","luckily it was warm and not windy. trees are \n","not very comfortable to sit in for long at any \n","time; but in the cold and the wind, with wolves \n","\n","\n","\n","all round below waiting for you, they can be \n","perfectly miserable places. \n","\n","this glade in the ring of trees was evidently \n","a meeting-place of the wolves. more and more \n","kept coming in. they left guards at the foot of \n","the tree in which dori and bilbo were, and then \n","went snuffling about till they had smelt out every \n","tree that had anyone in it. these they guarded \n","too, while all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it \n","seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the \n","glade; and in the middle of the circle was a \n","great grey wolf. he spoke to them in the \n","dreadful language of the wargs. gandalf \n","understood it. bilbo did not, but it sounded \n","terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about \n","cruel and wicked things, as it was. every now \n","and then all the wargs in the circle would \n","answer their grey chief all together, and their \n","dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall \n","out of his pine-tree. \n","\n","i will tell you what gandalf heard, though \n","bilbo did not understand it. the wargs and the \n","goblins often helped one another in wicked \n","deeds. goblins do not usually venture very far \n","from their mountains, unless they are driven out \n","and are looking for new homes, or are \n","marching to war (which i am glad to say has not \n","happened for a long while). but in those days \n","they sometimes used to go on raids, especially \n","to get food or slaves to work for them. then they \n","often got the wargs to help and shared the \n","\n","\n","\n","plunder with them. sometimes they rode on \n","wolves like men do on horses. now it seemed \n","that a great goblin-raid had been planned for \n","that very night. the wargs had come to meet \n","the goblins and the goblins were late. the \n","reason, no doubt, was the death of the great \n","goblin, and all the excitement caused by the \n","dwarves and bilbo and the wizard, for whom \n","they were probably still hunting. \n","\n","in spite of the dangers of this far land bold \n","men had of late been making their way back \n","into it from the south, cutting down trees, and \n","building themselves places to live in among the \n","more pleasant woods in the valleys and along \n","the river-shores. there were many of them, and \n","they were brave and well-armed, and even the \n","wargs dared not attack them if there were \n","many together, or in the bright day. but now they \n","had planned with the goblins' help to come by \n","night upon some of the villages nearest the \n","mountains. if their plan had been carried out, \n","there would have been none left there next day; \n","all would have been killed except the few the \n","goblins kept from the wolves and carried back \n","as prisoners to their caves. \n","\n","this was dreadful talk to listen to, not only \n","because of the brave woodmen and their wives \n","and children, but also because of the danger \n","which now threatened gandalf and his friends. \n","the wargs were angry and puzzled at finding \n","them here in their very meeting-place. they \n","\n","\n","\n","thought they were friends of the woodmen, and \n","were come to spy on them, and would take \n","news of their plans down into the valleys, and \n","then the goblins and the wolves would have to \n","fight a terrible battle instead of capturing \n","prisoners and devouring people waked \n","suddenly from their sleep. so the wargs had no \n","intention of going away and letting the people \n","up the trees escape, at any rate not until \n","morning. and long before that, they said, goblin \n","soldiers would be coming down from the \n","mountains; and goblins can climb trees, or cut \n","them down. \n","\n","now you can understand why gandalf, \n","listening to their growling and yelping, began to \n","be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and \n","to feel that they were in a very bad place, and \n","had not yet escaped at all. all the same he was \n","not going to let them have it all their own way, \n","though he could not do very much stuck up in a \n","tall tree with wolves all round on the ground \n","below. he gathered the huge pine-cones from \n","the branches of the tree. then he set one alight \n","with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down \n","among the circle of the wolves. it struck one on \n","the back, and immediately his shaggy coat \n","caught fire, and he was leaping to and fro \n","yelping horribly. then another came and \n","another, one in blue flames, one in red, another \n","in green. they burst on the ground in the middle \n","of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and \n","\n","\n","\n","smoke. a specially large one hit the chief wolf \n","on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet, \n","and then rushed round and round the circle \n","biting and snapping even at the other wolves in \n","his anger and fright. \n","\n","the dwarves and bilbo shouted and \n","cheered. the rage of the wolves was terrible to \n","see, and the commotion they made filled all the \n","forest. wolves are afraid of fire at all times, but \n","this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. if a \n","spark got in their coats it stuck and burned into \n","them, and unless they rolled over quick they \n","were soon all in flames. very soon all about the \n","glade wolves were rolling over and over to put \n","out the sparks on their backs, while those that \n","were burning were running about howling and \n","setting others alight, till their own friends chased \n","them away and they fled off down the slopes \n","crying and yammering and looking for water. \n","\n","\n","\"what is all this uproar in the forest tonight?\" \n","said the lord of the eagles. he was sitting, \n","black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely \n","pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the \n","mountains. \"i hear wolves' voices! are the \n","goblins at mischief in the woods?\" \n","\n","he swept up into the air, and immediately \n","two of his guards from the rocks at either hand \n","leaped up to follow him. they circled up in the \n","sky and looked down upon the ring of the \n","\n","\n","\n","wargs, a tiny spot far far below. but eagles \n","have keen eyes and can see small things at a \n","great distance. the lord of the eagles of the \n","misty mountains had eyes that could look at the \n","sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit moving \n","on the ground a mile below even in the \n","moonlight. so though he could not see the \n","people in the trees, he could make out the \n","commotion among the wolves and see the tiny \n","flashes of fire, and hear the howling and yelping \n","come up faint from far beneath him. also he \n","could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears \n","and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk \n","crept down the hillsides from their gate and \n","wound into the wood. \n","\n","eagles are not kindly birds. some are \n","cowardly and cruel. but the ancient race of the \n","northern mountains were the greatest of all \n","birds; they were proud and strong and noble- \n","hearted. they did not love goblins, or fear them. \n","when they took any notice of them at all (which \n","was seldom, for they did not eat such \n","creatures), they swooped on them and drove \n","them shrieking back to their caves, and \n","stopped whatever wickedness they were doing. \n","the goblins hated the eagles and feared them, \n","but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive \n","them from the mountains. \n","\n","tonight the lord of the eagles was filled \n","with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he \n","summoned many other eagles to him, and they \n","\n","\n","\n","flew away from the mountains, and slowly \n","circling ever round and round they came down, \n","down, down towards the ring of the wolves and \n","the meeting-place of the goblins. \n","\n","a very good thing too! dreadful things had \n","been going on down there. the wolves that had \n","caught fire and fled into the forest had set it \n","alight in several places, it was high summer, \n","and on this eastern side of the mountains there \n","had been little rain for some time. yellowing \n","bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine- \n","needles, and here and there dead trees, were \n","soon in flames. all round the clearing of the \n","wargs fire was leaping. but the wolf-guards did \n","not leave the trees. maddened and angry they \n","were leaping and howling round the trunks, and \n","cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, \n","with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes \n","shining as red and fierce as the flames. \n","\n","then suddenly goblins came running up \n","yelling. they thought a battle with the woodmen \n","was going on; but they soon learned what had \n","really happened. some of them actually sat \n","down and laughed. others waved their spears \n","and clashed the shafts against their shields. \n","goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had \n","a plan which seemed to them most amusing. \n","\n","some got all the wolves together in a pack. \n","some stacked fern and brushwood round the \n","tree-trunks. others rushed round and stamped \n","and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all \n","\n","\n","\n","the flames were put out - but they did not put \n","out the fire nearest to the trees where the \n","dwarves were. that fire they fed with leaves and \n","dead branches and bracken. soon they had a \n","ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, \n","a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; \n","but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was \n","licking the fuel piled under the trees. smoke \n","was in bilbo's eyes, he could feel the heat of \n","the flames; and through the reek he could see \n","the goblins dancing round and round in a circle \n","like people round a midsummer bonfire. \n","outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears \n","and axes stood the wolves at a respectful \n","distance, watching and waiting. \n","\n","he could hear the goblins beginning a \n","horrible song: \n","\n","\n","fifteen birds in five fir-trees, \n","\n","their feathers were fanned in a fiery \n","\n","breeze! \n","\n","but, funny little birds, they had no wings! \n","\n","o what shall we do with the funny little \n","things? \n","\n","roast 'em alive, orstewthem in a pot; \n","fry them, boil them and eat them hot? \n","\n","\n","then they stopped and shouted out: \"fly \n","away little birds! fly away if you can! come \n","down little birds, or you will get roasted in your \n","\n","\n","\n","nests! sing, sing little birds! why don't you \n","sing?\" \n","\n","\"go away! little boys!\" shouted gandalf in \n","answer. \"it isn't bird-nesting time. also naughty \n","little boys that play with fire get punished.\" he \n","said it to make them angry, and to show them \n","he was not frightened of them - though of \n","course he was, wizard though he was. but they \n","took no notice, and they went on singing. \n","\n","\n","bum, bum tree and fern! \n","\n","shrivel and scorch! a fizzling torch \n","to light the night for our delight, \n","\n","ya hey! \n","\n","bake and toast 'em, fry and roast 'em! \n","till beards blaze, and eyes glaze; \n","till hair smells and skins crack, \n","fat melts, and bones black \n","in cinders lie \n","beneath the sky! \n","\n","so dwarves shall die, \n","and light the night for our delight, \n","\n","ya hey! \n","\n","ya-harri-hey! \n","\n","ya hoy! \n","\n","\n","and with that ya hoy\\ the flames were \n","under gandalf s tree. in a moment it spread to \n","the others. the bark caught fire, the lower \n","\n","\n","\n","branches cracked. \n","\n","then gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. \n","the sudden splendour flashed from his wand \n","like lightning, as he got ready to spring down \n","from on high right among the spears of the \n","goblins. that would have been the end of him, \n","though he would probably have killed many of \n","them as he came hurtling down like a \n","thunderbolt. but he never leaped. \n","\n","just at that moment the lord of the eagles \n","swept down from above, seized him in his \n","talons, and was gone. \n","\n","\n","there was a howl of anger and surprise from \n","the goblins. loud cried the lord of the eagles, \n","to whom gandalf had now spoken. back swept \n","the great birds that were with him, and down \n","they came like huge black shadows. the \n","wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the \n","goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung \n","their heavy spears in the air in vain. over them \n","swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their \n","beating wings smote them to the floor or drove \n","them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. \n","other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the \n","dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far \n","as they ever dared to go. \n","\n","poor little bilbo was very nearly left behind \n","again! he just managed to catch hold of dori's \n","legs, as dori was borne off last of all; and up \n","\n","\n","\n","they went together above the tumult and the \n","burning, bilbo swinging in the air with his arms \n","nearly breaking. \n","\n","now far below the goblins and the wolves \n","were scattering far and wide in the woods. a \n","few eagles were still circling and sweeping \n","above the battleground. the flames about the \n","trees sprang suddenly up above the highest \n","branches. they went up in crackling fire. there \n","was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke. bilbo \n","had escaped only just in time! \n","\n","soon the light of the burning was faint \n","below, a red twinkle on the black floor; and they \n","were high up in the sky, rising all the time in \n","strong sweeping circles. bilbo never forgot that \n","flight, clinging onto dori's ankles. he moaned \n","\"my arms, my arms!\"; but dori groaned \"my \n","poor legs, my poor legs!\" \n","\n","at the best of times heights made bilbo \n","giddy. he used to turn queer if he looked over \n","the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never \n","liked ladders, let alone trees (never having had \n","to escape from wolves before). so you can \n","imagine how his head swam now, when he \n","looked down between his dangling toes and \n","saw the dark lands opening wide underneath \n","him, touched here and there with the light of the \n","moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the \n","plains. \n","\n","the pale peaks of the mountains were \n","coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock sticking \n","\n","\n","\n","out of black shadows. summer or not, it \n","seemed very cold. he shut his eyes and \n","wondered if he could hold on any longer. then \n","he imagined what would happen if he did not. \n","he felt sick. \n","\n","the flight ended only just in time for him, just \n","before his arms gave way. he loosed dori's \n","ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough \n","platform of an eagle's eyrie. there he lay \n","without speaking, and his thoughts were a \n","mixture of surprise at being saved from the fire, \n","and fear lest he fall off that narrow place into the \n","deep shadows on either side. he was feeling \n","very queer indeed in his head by this time after \n","the dreadful adventures of the last three days \n","with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself \n","saying aloud: \"now i know what a piece of \n","bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out \n","of the pan on a fork and put back on the shelf!\" \n","\n","\"no you don't!\" he heard dori answering, \n","\"because the bacon knows that it will get back \n","in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped \n","we shan't. also eagles aren't forks!\" \n","\n","\"o no! not a bit like storks - forks, i mean,\" \n","said bilbo sitting up and looking anxiously at \n","the eagle who was perched close by. he \n","wondered what other nonsense he had been \n","saying, and if the eagle would think it rude. you \n","ought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are \n","only the size of a hobbit, and are up in his eyrie \n","at night! \n","\n","\n","\n","the eagle only sharpened his beak on a \n","stone and trimmed his feathers and took no \n","notice. \n","\n","soon another eagle flew up. \"the lord of \n","the eagles bids you to bring your prisoners to \n","the great shelf,\" he cried and was off again. \n","the other seized dori in his claws and flew \n","away with him into the night leaving bilbo all \n","alone. he had just strength to wonder what the \n","messenger had meant by 'prisoners,' and to \n","begin to think of being torn up for supper like a \n","rabbit, when his own turn came. \n","\n","the eagle came back, seized him in his \n","talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off. \n","this time he flew only a short way. very soon \n","bilbo was laid down, trembling with fear, on a \n","wide shelf of rock on the mountain-side. there \n","was no path down on to it save by flying; and no \n","path down off it except by jumping over a \n","precipice. there he found all the others sitting \n","with their backs to the mountain wall. the lord \n","of the eagles also was there and was speaking \n","to gandalf. \n","\n","it seemed that bilbo was not going to be \n","eaten after all. the wizard and the eagle-lord \n","appeared to know one another slightly, and \n","even to be on friendly terms. as a matter of fact \n","gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, \n","had once rendered a service to the eagles and \n","healed their lord from an arrow-wound. so you \n","see 'prisoners' had meant 'prisoners rescued \n","\n","\n","\n","from the goblins' only, and not captives of the \n","eagles. as bilbo listened to the talk of gandalf \n","he realized that at last they were going to \n","escape really and truly from the dreadful \n","mountains. he was discussing plans with the \n","great eagle for carrying the dwarves and \n","himself and bilbo far away and setting them \n","down well on their journey across the plains \n","below. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the misty mountains looking west from the \n","eyrie towards goblin gate \n","\n","\n","the lord of the eagles would not take them \n","anywhere near where men lived. \"they would \n","shoot at us with their great bows of yew,\" he \n","said, \"for they would think we were after their \n","sheep. and at other times they would be right. \n","no! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their \n","sport, and glad to repay our thanks to you, but \n","we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the \n","southward plains.\" \n","\n","\"very well,\" said gandalf. \"take us where \n","and as far as you will! we are already deeply \n","obliged to you. but in the meantime we are \n","famished with hunger.\" \n","\n","\"i am nearly dead of it,\" said bilbo in a weak \n","little voice that nobody heard. \n","\n","\"that can perhaps be mended,\" said the \n","lord of the eagles. \n","\n","later on you might have seen a bright fire \n","on the shelf of rock and the figures of the \n","dwarves round it cooking and making a fine \n","roasting smell. the eagles had brought up dry \n","boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits, \n","hares, and a small sheep. the dwarves \n","managed all the preparations. bilbo was too \n","weak to help, and anyway he was not much \n","good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, \n","being used to having it delivered by the butcher \n","\n","\n","\n","all ready to cook. gandalf, too, was lying down \n","after doing his part in setting the fire going, \n","since oin and gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. \n","(dwarves have never taken to matches even \n","yet.) \n","\n","so ended the adventures of the misty \n","mountains. soon bilbo's stomach was feeling \n","full and comfortable again, and he felt he could \n","sleep contentedly, though really he would have \n","liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat \n","toasted on sticks. he slept curled up on the \n","hard rock more soundly than ever he had done \n","on his feather-bed in his own little hole at home. \n","but all night he dreamed of his own house and \n","wandered in his sleep into all his different \n","rooms looking for something that he could not \n","find nor remember what it looked like. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter vii \n","\n","\n","queer lodgings \n","\n","\n","the next morning bilbo woke up with the early \n","sun in his eyes. he jumped up to look at the \n","time and to go and put his kettle on - and found \n","he was not home at all. so he sat down and \n","wished in vain for a wash and a brush. he did \n","not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for \n","his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit. and \n","after that he had to get ready for a fresh start. \n","\n","this time he was allowed to climb on to an \n","eagle's back and cling between his wings. the \n","air rushed over him and he shut his eyes. the \n","dwarves were crying farewells and promising to \n","repay the lord of the eagles if ever they could, \n","as off rose fifteen great birds from the \n","mountain's side. the sun was still close to the \n","eastern edge of things. the morning was cool, \n","and mists were in the valleys and hollows and \n","twined here and there about the peaks and \n","pinnacles of the hills. bilbo opened an eye to \n","peep and saw that the birds were already high \n","\n","\n","up and the world was far away, and the \n","mountains were falling back behind them into \n","the distance. he shut his eyes again and held \n","on tighter. \n","\n","\"don't pinch!\" said his eagle. \"you need not \n","be frightened like a rabbit, even if you look \n","rather like one. it is a fair morning with little \n","wind. what is finer than flying?\" \n","\n","bilbo would have liked to say: \"a warm bath \n","and late breakfast on the lawn afterwards;\" but \n","he thought it better to say nothing at all, and to \n","let go his clutch just a tiny bit. \n","\n","after a good while the eagles must have \n","seen the point they were making for, even from \n","their great height, for they began to go down \n","circling round in great spirals. they did this for a \n","long while, and at last the hobbit opened his \n","eyes again. the earth was much nearer, and \n","below them were trees that looked like oaks \n","and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river \n","running through it all. but cropping out of the \n","ground, right in the path of the stream which \n","looped itself about it, was a great rock, almost \n","a hill of stone, like a last outpost of the distant \n","mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the \n","plain by some giant among giants. \n","\n","quickly now to the top of this rock the \n","eagles swooped one by one and set down their \n","passengers. \n","\n","\"farewell!\" they cried, \"wherever you fare, \n","\n","\n","\n","till your eyries receive you at the journey's end!\" \n","that is the polite thing to say among eagles. \n","\n","\"may the wind under your wings bear you \n","where the sun sails and the moon walks,\" \n","answered gandalf, who knew the correct reply. \n","\n","and so they parted. and though the lord of \n","the eagles became in after days the king of all \n","birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen \n","chieftains golden collars (made of the gold that \n","the dwarves gave them), bilbo never saw them \n","again - except high and far off in the battle of \n","five armies. but as that comes in at the end of \n","this tale we will say no more about it just now. \n","\n","there was a flat space on the top of the hill \n","of stone and a well worn path with many steps \n","leading down it to the river, across which a ford \n","of huge flat stones led to the grass-land beyond \n","the stream. there was a little cave (a \n","wholesome one with a pebbly floor) at the foot \n","of the steps and near the end of the stony ford. \n","here the party gathered and discussed what \n","was to be done. \n","\n","\"i always meant to see you all safe (if \n","possible) over the mountains,\" said the wizard, \n","\"and now by good management and good luck i \n","have done it. indeed we are now a good deal \n","further east than i ever meant to come with you, \n","for after all this is not my adventure. i may look \n","in on it again before it is all over, but in the \n","meanwhile i have some other pressing \n","\n","\n","\n","business to attend to.\" \n","\n","the dwarves groaned and looked most \n","distressed, and bilbo wept. they had begun to \n","think gandalf was going to come all the way \n","and would always be there to help them out of \n","difficulties. \"i am not going to disappear this \n","very instant,\" said he. \"i can give you a day or \n","two more. probably i can help you out of your \n","present plight, and i need a little help myself. \n","we have no food, and no baggage, and no \n","ponies to ride; and you don't know where you \n","are. now i can tell you that. you are still some \n","miles north of the path which we should have \n","been following, if we had not left the mountain \n","pass in a hurry. very few people live in these \n","parts, unless they have come here since i was \n","last down this way, which is some years ago. \n","but there is somebody that i know of, who lives \n","not far away. that somebody made the steps \n","on the great rock - the carrock i believe he \n","calls it. he does not come here often, certainly \n","not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for \n","him. in fact it would be very dangerous. we \n","must go and find him; and if all goes well at our \n","meeting, i think i shall be off and wish you like \n","the eagles 'farewell wherever you fare! ' \" \n","\n","they begged him not to leave them. they \n","offered him dragon-gold and silver and jewels, \n","but he would not change his mind. \"we shall \n","see, we shall see!\" he said, \"and i think i have \n","\n","\n","\n","earned already some of your dragon-gold - \n","when you have got it.\" \n","\n","\n","after that they stopped pleading. then they took \n","off their clothes and bathed in the river, which \n","was shallow and clear and stony at the ford. \n","when they had dried in the sun, which was now \n","strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still \n","sore and a little hungry. soon they crossed the \n","ford (carrying the hobbit), and then began to \n","march through the long green grass and down \n","the lines of the wide-armed oaks and the tall \n","elms. \n","\n","\"and why is it called the carrock?\" asked \n","bilbo as he went along at the wizard's side. \n","\n","\"he called it the carrock, because carrock \n","is his word for it. he calls things like that \n","carrocks, and this one is the carrock because \n","it is the only one near his home and he knows it \n","well.\" \n","\n","\"who calls it? who knows it?\" \n","\n","\"the somebody i spoke of - a very great \n","person. you must all be very polite when i \n","introduce you. i shall introduce you slowly, two \n","by two, i think; and you must be careful not to \n","annoy him, or heaven knows what will happen. \n","he can be appalling when he is angry, though \n","he is kind enough if humoured. still i warn you \n","\n","\n","\n","he gets angry easily.\" \n","\n","the dwarves all gathered round when they \n","heard the wizard talking like this to bilbo. \"is \n","that the person you are taking us to now?\" they \n","asked. \"couldn't you find someone more easy- \n","tempered? hadn't you better explain it all a bit \n","clearer?\" - and so on. \n","\n","\"yes it certainly is! no i could not! and i was \n","explaining very carefully\" answered the wizard \n","crossly. \"if you must know more, his name is \n","beorn. he is very strong, and he is a skin- \n","changer.\" \n","\n","\"what! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits \n","conies, when he doesn't turn their skins into \n","squirrels?\" asked bilbo. \n","\n","\"good gracious heavens, no, no, no, no!\" \n","said gandalf. \"don't be a fool mr. baggins if \n","you can help it; and in the name of all wonder \n","don't mention the word furrier again as long as \n","you are within a hundred miles of his house, nor \n","rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such \n","unfortunate word! he is a skin-changer. he \n","changes his skin: sometimes he is a huge \n","black bear, sometimes he is a great strong \n","black-haired man with huge arms and a great \n","beard. i cannot tell you much more, though that \n","ought to be enough. some say that he is a bear \n","descended from the great and ancient bears of \n","the mountains that lived there before the giants \n","came. others say that he is a man descended \n","\n","\n","\n","from the first men who lived before smaug or \n","the other dragons came into this part of the \n","world, and before the goblins came into the hills \n","out of the north. i cannot say, though i fancy the \n","last is the true tale. he is not the sort of person \n","to ask questions of. \n","\n","\"at any rate he is under no enchantment but \n","his own. he lives in an oak-wood and has a \n","great wooden house; and as a man he keeps \n","cattle and horses which are nearly as \n","marvellous as himself. they work for him and \n","talk to him. he does not eat them; neither does \n","he hunt or eat wild animals. he keeps hives and \n","hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on \n","cream and honey. as a bear he ranges far and \n","wide. i once saw him sitting all alone on the top \n","of the carrock at night watching the moon \n","sinking towards the misty mountains, and i \n","heard him growl in the tongue of bears: the \n","day will come when they will perish and i shall \n","go back!' that is why i believe he once came \n","from the mountains himself.\" \n","\n","\n","bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think \n","about, and they asked no more questions. they \n","still had a long way to walk before them. up \n","slope and down dale they plodded. it grew very \n","hot. sometimes they rested under the trees, \n","and then bilbo felt so hungry that he would have \n","\n","\n","\n","eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough yet \n","to have fallen to the ground. \n","\n","it was the middle of the afternoon before \n","they noticed that great patches of flowers had \n","begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing \n","together as if they had been planted. especially \n","there was clover, waving patches of cockscomb \n","clover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of \n","short white sweet honey-smelling clover. there \n","was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in \n","the air. bees were busy everywhere. and such \n","bees! bilbo had never seen anything like them. \n","\n","\"if one was to sting me,\" he thought, \"i \n","should swell up as big again as i am!\" \n","\n","they were bigger than hornets. the drones \n","were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, and \n","the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies \n","shone like fiery gold. \n","\n","\"we are getting near,\" said gandalf. \"we \n","are on the edge of his bee-pastures.\" \n","\n","\n","after a while they came to a belt of tall and very \n","ancient oaks, and beyond these to a high thorn- \n","hedge through which you could neither see nor \n","scramble. \n","\n","\"you had better wait here,\" said the wizard \n","to the dwarves; \"and when i call or whistle begin \n","to come after me - you will see the way i go - \n","\n","\n","\n","but only in pairs, mind, about five minutes \n","between each pair of you. bombur is fattest and \n","will do for two, he had better come alone and \n","last. come on mr. baggins! there is a gate \n","somewhere round this way.\" and with that he \n","went off along the hedge taking the frightened \n","hobbit with him. \n","\n","they soon came to a wooden gate, high \n","and broad, beyond which they could see \n","gardens and a cluster of low wooden buildings, \n","some thatched and made of unshaped logs: \n","barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden \n","house. inside on the southward side of the great \n","hedge were rows and rows of hives with bell- \n","shaped tops made of straw. the noise of the \n","giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in and \n","out filled all the air. \n","\n","the wizard and the hobbit pushed open the \n","heavy creaking gate and went down a wide \n","track towards the house. some horses, very \n","sleek and well-groomed, trotted up across the \n","grass and looked at them intently with very \n","intelligent faces; then off they galloped to the \n","buildings. \n","\n","\"they have gone to tell him of the arrival of \n","strangers,\" said gandalf. \n","\n","soon they reached a courtyard, three walls \n","of which were formed by the wooden house and \n","its two long wings. in the middle there was lying \n","a great oak-trunk with many lopped branches \n","\n","\n","\n","beside it. standing near was a huge man with a \n","thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms \n","and legs with knotted muscles. he was clothed \n","in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was \n","leaning on a large axe. the horses were \n","standing by him with their noses at his shoulder. \n","\n","\"ugh! here they are!\" he said to the horses. \n","\"they don't look dangerous. you can be off!\" he \n","laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe \n","and came forward. \n","\n","\"who are you and what do you want?\" he \n","asked gruffly, standing in front of them and \n","towering tall above gandalf. as for bilbo he \n","could easily have trotted through his legs \n","without ducking his head to miss the fringe of \n","the man's brown tunic. \n","\n","\"i am gandalf,\" said the wizard. \n","\n","\"never heard of him,\" growled the man. \n","\"and what's this little fellow?\" he said, stooping \n","down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy black \n","eyebrows. \n","\n","\"that is mr. baggins, a hobbit of good \n","family and unimpeachable reputation,\" said \n","gandalf. bilbo bowed. he had no hat to take \n","off, and was painfully conscious of his many \n","missing buttons. \"i am a wizard,\" continued \n","gandalf. \"i have heard of you, if you have not \n","heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my \n","good cousin radagast who lives near the \n","southern borders of mirkwood?\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, i \n","believe. i used to see him now and again,\" said \n","beorn. \"well, now i know who you are, or who \n","you say you are. what do you want?\" \n","\n","\"to tell you the truth, we have lost our \n","luggage and nearly lost our way, and are rather \n","in need of help, or at least of advice. i may say \n","we have had rather a bad time with goblins in \n","the mountains.\" \n","\n","\"goblins?\" said the big man less gruffly. \"o \n","ho, so you've been having trouble with them \n","have you? what did you go near them for?\" \n","\n","\"we did not mean to. they surprised us at \n","night in a pass which we had to cross; we were \n","coming out of the lands over west into these \n","countries - it is a long tale.\" \n","\n","\"then you had better come inside and tell \n","me some of it, if it won't take all day,\" said the \n","man leading the way through a dark door that \n","opened out of the courtyard into the house. \n","\n","following him they found themselves in a \n","wide hall with a fire-place in the middle. though \n","it was summer there was a wood-fire burning \n","and the smoke was rising to the blackened \n","rafters in search of the way out through an \n","opening in the roof. they passed through this \n","dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole above it, \n","and came through another smaller door into a \n","sort of veranda propped on wooden posts \n","made of single tree-trunks. it faced south and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","was still warm and filled with the light of the \n","westering sun which slanted into it, and fell \n","golden on the garden full of flowers that came \n","right up to the steps. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","foro'smi \n","\n","\n","here they sat on wooden benches while \n","gandalf began his tale, and bilbo swung his \n","dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the \n","garden, wondering what their names could be, \n","as he had never seen half of them before. \n","\n","\"i was coming over the mountains with a \n","friend or two. . .\" said the wizard. \n","\n","\"or two? i can only see one, and a little one \n","at that,\" said beorn. \n","\n","\"well to tell you the truth, i did not like to \n","bother you with a lot of us, until i found out if you \n","were busy. i will give a call, if i may.\" \n","\n","\"go on, call away!\" \n","\n","so gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and \n","presently thorin and dori came round the \n","house by the garden path and stood bowing low \n","before them. \n","\n","\"one or three you meant, i see!\" said beorn. \n","\"but these aren't hobbits, they are dwarves!\" \n","\n","\"thorin oakenshield, at your service! dori \n","at your service!\" said the two dwarves bowing \n","again. \n","\n","\"i don't need your service, thank you,\" said \n","\n","\n","beorn, \"but i expect you need mine. i am not \n","over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are \n","thorin (son of thrain, son of thror, i believe), \n","and that your companion is respectable, and \n","that you are enemies of goblins and are not up \n","to any mischief in my lands - what are you up \n","to, by the way?\" \n","\n","\"they are on their way to visit the land of \n","their fathers, away east beyond mirkwood,\" put \n","in gandalf, \"and it is entirely an accident that we \n","are in your lands at all. we were crossing by the \n","high pass that should have brought us to the \n","road that lies to the south of your country, when \n","we were attacked by the evil goblins - as i was \n","about to tell you.\" \n","\n","\"go on telling, then!\" said beorn, who was \n","never very polite. \n","\n","\"there was a terrible storm; the stone- \n","giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of \n","the pass we took refuge in a cave, the hobbit \n","and i and several of our companions. . .\" \n","\n","\"do you call two several?\" \n","\n","\"well, no. as a matter of fact there were \n","more than two.\" \n","\n","\"where are they? killed, eaten, gone \n","home?\" \n","\n","\"well, no. they don't seem all to have come \n","when i whistled. shy, i expect. you see, we are \n","very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you \n","to entertain.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"go on, whistle again! lam in for a party, it \n","seems, and one or two more won't make much \n","difference,\" growled beorn. \n","\n","gandalf whistled again; but nori and ori \n","were there almost before he had stopped, for, if \n","you remember, gandalf had told them to come \n","in pairs every five minutes. \n","\n","\"hullo!\" said beorn. \"you came pretty quick \n","- where were you hiding? come on my jack-in- \n","the-boxes!\" \n","\n","\"nori at your service, ori at. . .\" they began; \n","but beorn interrupted them. \n","\n","\"thank you! when i want your help i will ask \n","for it. sit down, and let's get on with this tale, or \n","it will be supper-time before it is ended.\" \n","\n","\"as soon as we were asleep,\" went on \n","gandalf, \"a crack at the back of the cave \n","opened; goblins came out and grabbed the \n","hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies \n","\n","\"troop of ponies? what were you - a \n","travelling circus? or were you carrying lots of \n","goods? or do you always call six a troop?\" \n","\n","\"o no! as a matter of fact there were more \n","than six ponies, for there were more than six of \n","us - and well, here are two more!\" just at that \n","moment balin and dwalin appeared and \n","bowed so low that their beards swept the stone \n","floor. the big man was frowning at first, but they \n","did their best to be frightfully polite, and kept on \n","\n","\n","\n","nodding and bending and bowing and waving \n","their hoods before their knees (in proper dwarf- \n","fashion), till he stopped frowning and burst into \n","a chuckling laugh: they looked so comical. \n","\n","\"troop, was right,\" he said. \"a fine comic \n","one. come in my merry men, and what are your \n","names? i don't want your service just now, only \n","your names; and then sit down and stop \n","wagging!\" \n","\n","\"balin and dwalin,\" they said not daring to \n","be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking \n","rather surprised. \n","\n","\"now go on again!\" said beorn to the \n","wizard. \n","\n","\"where was i? o yes - i was not grabbed. i \n","killed a goblin or two with a flash - \" \n","\n","\"good!\" growled beorn. \"it is some good \n","being a wizard, then.\" \n","\n","\" - and slipped inside the crack before it \n","closed. i followed down into the main hall, which \n","was crowded with goblins. the great goblin \n","was there with thirty or forty armed guards. i \n","thought to myself 'even if they were not all \n","chained together, what can a dozen do against \n","so many?'\" \n","\n","\"a dozen! that's the first time i've heard \n","eight called a dozen. or have you still got some \n","more jacks that haven't yet come out of their \n","boxes?\" \n","\n","\"well, yes, there seem to be a couple more \n","\n","\n","\n","here now - fili and kili, i believe,\" said gandalf, \n","as these two now appeared and stood smiling \n","and bowing. \n","\n","\"that's enough!\" said beorn. \"sit down and \n","be quiet! now go on, gandalf!\" \n","\n","so gandalf went on with the tale, until he \n","came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of \n","the lower gate, and their horror when they found \n","that mr. baggins had been mislaid. \"we \n","counted ourselves and found that there was no \n","hobbit. there were only fourteen of us left!\" \n","\n","\"fourteen! that's the first time i've heard \n","one from ten leave fourteen. you mean nine, or \n","else you haven't told me yet all the names of \n","your party.\" \n","\n","\"well, of course you haven't seen oin and \n","gloin yet. and, bless me! here they are. i hope \n","you will forgive them for bothering you.\" \n","\n","\"o let 'em all come! hurry up! come along, \n","you two, and sit down! but look here, gandalf, \n","even now we have only got yourself and ten \n","dwarves and the hobbit that was lost. that only \n","makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not \n","fourteen, unless wizards count differently to \n","other people. but now please get on with the \n","tale.\" beorn did not show it more than he could \n","help, but really he had begun to get very \n","interested. you see, in the old days he had \n","known the very part of the mountains that \n","gandalf was describing. he nodded and he \n","\n","\n","\n","growled, when he heard of the hobbit's \n","reappearance and of their scramble down the \n","stone-slide and of the wolf-ring in the woods. \n","\n","when gandalf came to their climbing into \n","trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up \n","and strode about and muttered: \"i wish i had \n","been there! i would have given them more than \n","fireworks!\" \n","\n","\"well,\" said gandalf very glad to see that \n","his tale was making a good impression, \"i did \n","the best i could. there we were with the wolves \n","going mad underneath us and the forest \n","beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins \n","came down from the hills and discovered us. \n","they yelled with delight and sang songs making \n","fun of us. fifteen birds in live fir-trees . . \n","\n","\"good heavens!\" growled beorn. \"don't \n","pretend that goblins can't count. they can. \n","twelve isn't fifteen and they know it.\" \n","\n","\"and so do i. there were bifur and bofur as \n","well. i haven't ventured to introduce them \n","before, but here they are.\" \n","\n","in came bifur and bofur. \"and me!\" gasped \n","bombur puffing up behind. he was fat, and also \n","angry at being left till last. he refused to wait \n","five minutes, and followed immediately after the \n","other two. \n","\n","\"well, now there are fifteen of you; and \n","since goblins can count, i suppose that is all \n","that there were up the trees. now perhaps we \n","\n","\n","\n","can finish this story without any more \n","interruptions.\" mr. baggins saw then how clever \n","gandalf had been. the interruptions had really \n","made beorn more interested in the story, and \n","the story had kept him from sending the \n","dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. \n","he never invited people into his house, if he \n","could help it. he had very few friends and they \n","lived a good way away; and he never invited \n","more than a couple of these to his house at a \n","time. now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in \n","his porch! \n","\n","by the time the wizard had finished his tale \n","and had told of the eagles' rescue and of how \n","they had all been brought to the carrock, the \n","sun had fallen behind the peaks of the misty \n","mountains and the shadows were long in \n","beorn's garden. \n","\n","\"avery good tale!\" said he. \"the best i have \n","heard for a long while. if all beggars could tell \n","such a good one, they might find me kinder. \n","you may be making it all up, of course, but you \n","deserve a supper for the story all the same. \n","let's have something to eat!\" \n","\n","\"yes please!\" they all said together. \"thank \n","you very much!\" \n","\n","\n","inside the hall it was now quite dark. beorn \n","clapped his hands, and in trotted four beautiful \n","\n","\n","\n","white ponies and several large long-bodied \n","grey dogs. beorn said something to them in a \n","queer language like animal noises turned into \n","talk. they went out again and soon came back \n","carrying torches in their mouths, which they lit at \n","the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars \n","of the hall about the central hearth. the dogs \n","could stand on their hind-legs when they \n","wished, and carry things with their fore-feet. \n","quickly they got out boards and trestles from \n","the side walls and set them up near the fire. \n","\n","then baa - baa - baa! was heard, and in \n","came some snow-white sheep led by a large \n","coal-black ram. one bore a white cloth \n","embroidered at the edges with figures of \n","animals; others bore on their broad backs trays \n","with bowls and platters and knives and wooden \n","spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on \n","the trestle-tables. these were very low, low \n","enough even for bilbo to sit at comfortably. \n","beside them a pony pushed two low-seated \n","benches with wide rush-bottoms and little short \n","thick legs for gandalf and thorin, while at the \n","far end he put beorn's big black chair of the \n","same sort (in which he sat with his great legs \n","stuck far out under the table). these were all the \n","chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had \n","them low like the tables for the convenience of \n","the wonderful animals that waited on him. what \n","did the rest sit on? they were not forgotten. the \n","\n","\n","\n","other ponies came in rolling round drum- \n","shaped sections of logs, smoothed and \n","polished, and low enough even for bilbo; so \n","soon they were all seated at beorn's table, and \n","the hall had not seen such a gathering for many \n","a year. \n","\n","there they had a supper, or a dinner, such \n","as they had not had since they left the last \n","homely house in the west and said good-bye \n","to elrond. the light of the torches and the fire \n","flickered about them, and on the table were two \n","tall red beeswax candles. all the time they ate, \n","beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the \n","wild lands on this side of the mountains, and \n","especially of the dark and dangerous wood, \n","that lay outstretched far to north and south a \n","day's ride before them, barring their way to the \n","east, the terrible forest of mirkwood. \n","\n","the dwarves listened and shook their \n","beards, for they knew that they must soon \n","venture into that forest and that after the \n","mountains it was the worst of the perils they had \n","to pass before they came to the dragon's \n","stronghold. when dinner was over they began \n","to tell tales of their own, but beorn seemed to \n","be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them. \n","they spoke most of gold and silver and jewels \n","and the making of things by smith-craft, and \n","beorn did not appear to care for such things: \n","there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, \n","\n","\n","\n","and few save the knives were made of metal at \n","all. \n","\n","they sat long at the table with their wooden \n","drinking-bowls filled with mead. the dark night \n","came on outside. the fires in the middle of the \n","hall were built with fresh logs and the torches \n","were put out, and still they sat in the light of the \n","dancing flames with the pillars of the house \n","standing tall behind them, and dark at the top \n","like trees of the forest. whether it was magic or \n","not, it seemed to bilbo that he heard a sound \n","like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters, \n","and the hoot of owls. soon he began to nod \n","with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far \n","away, until he woke with a start. \n","\n","the great door had creaked and slammed. \n","beorn was gone. the dwarves were sitting \n","cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and \n","presently they began to sing. some of the \n","verses were like this, but there were many \n","more, and their singing went on for a long while: \n","\n","\n","the wind was on the withered heath, \n","but in the forest stirred no leaf: \n","there shadows lay by night and day, \n","and dark things silent crept beneath. \n","\n","\n","\n","the wind came down from mountains \n","cold, \n","\n","and like a tide it roared and rolled; \n","the branches groaned, the forest moaned, \n","and leaves were laid upon the mould. \n","\n","\n","the wind went on from west to east; \n","all movement in the forest ceased, \n","but shrill and harsh across the marsh \n","its whistling voices were released. \n","\n","\n","the grasses hissed, their tassels bent, \n","the reeds were rattling - on it went \n","o'er shaken pool under heavens cool \n","where racing clouds were tom and rent. \n","\n","\n","it passed the lonely mountain bare \n","and swept above the dragon's lair: \n","there black and dark lay boulders stark \n","and flying smoke was in the air. \n","\n","\n","\n","it left the world and took its flight \n","over the wide seas of the night. \n","\n","the moon set sail upon the gale, \n","and stars were fanned to leaping light. \n","\n","\n","bilbo began to nod again. suddenly up \n","stood gandalf. \n","\n","\"it is time for us to sleep,'' he said, \" - for us, \n","but not i think for beorn. in this hall we can rest \n","sound and safe, but i warn you all not to forget \n","what beorn said before he left us: you must not \n","stray outside until the sun is up, on your peril.\" \n","\n","bilbo found that beds had already been laid \n","at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised \n","platform between the pillars and the outer wall. \n","for him there was a little mattress of straw and \n","woollen blankets. he snuggled into them very \n","gladly, summertime though it was. the fire \n","burned low and he fell asleep. yet in the night \n","he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few \n","embers; the dwarves and gandalf were all \n","asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of \n","white on the floor came from the high moon, \n","which was peering down through the smoke- \n","hole in the roof. \n","\n","there was a growling sound outside, and a \n","noise as of some great animal scuffling at the \n","door. bilbo wondered what it was, and whether \n","it could be beorn in enchanted shape, and if he \n","\n","\n","\n","would come in as a bear and kill them. he \n","dived under the blankets and hid his head, and \n","fell asleep again at last in spite of his fears. \n","\n","\n","it was full morning when he awoke. one of the \n","dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows \n","where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump \n","from the platform on to the floor. it was bofur, \n","and he was grumbling about it, when bilbo \n","opened his eyes. \n","\n","\"get up lazybones,\" he said, \"or there will be \n","no breakfast left for you.\" \n","\n","up jumped bilbo. \"breakfast!\" he cried. \n","\"where is breakfast?\" \n","\n","\"mostly inside us,\" answered the other \n","dwarves who were moving about the hall; \"but \n","what is left is out on the veranda. we have been \n","about looking for beorn ever since the sun got \n","up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though \n","we found breakfast laid as soon as we went \n","out.\" \n","\n","\"where is gandalf?\" asked bilbo, moving \n","off to find something to eat as quick as he \n","could. \n","\n","\"o! out and about somewhere,\" they told \n","him. but he saw no sign of the wizard all that \n","day until the evening. just before sunset he \n","walked into the hall, where the hobbit and the \n","dwarves were having supper, waited on by \n","\n","\n","\n","beorn's wonderful animals, as they had been all \n","day. of beorn they had seen and heard nothing \n","since the night before, and they were getting \n","puzzled. \n","\n","\"where is our host, and where have you \n","been all day yourself?\" they all cried. \n","\n","\"one question at a time - and none till after \n","supper! i haven't had a bite since breakfast.\" \n","\n","at last gandalf pushed away his plate and \n","jug - he had eaten two whole loaves (with \n","masses of butter and honey and clotted cream) \n","and drunk at least a quart of mead - and he \n","took out his pipe. \"i will answer the second \n","question first,\" he said, \" - but bless me! this is \n","a splendid place for smoke rings!\" indeed for a \n","long time they could get nothing more out of \n","him, he was so busy sending smoke rings \n","dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing \n","them into all sorts of different shapes and \n","colours, and setting them at last chasing one \n","another out of the hole in the roof. they must \n","have looked very queer from outside, popping \n","out into the air one after another, green, blue, \n","red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little \n","ones; little ones dodging through big ones and \n","joining into figure-eights, and going off like a \n","flock of birds into the distance. \n","\n","\"i have been picking out bear-tracks,\" he \n","said at last. \"there must have been a regular \n","bears' meeting outside here last night. i soon \n","\n","\n","\n","saw that beorn could not have made them all: \n","there were far too many of them, and they were \n","of various sizes too. i should say there were \n","little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and \n","gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from \n","dark to nearly dawn. they came from almost \n","every direction, except from the west over the \n","river, from the mountains. in that direction only \n","one set of footprints led - none coming, only \n","ones going away from here. i followed these as \n","far as the carrock. there they disappeared into \n","the river, but the water was too deep and strong \n","beyond the rock for me to cross. it is easy \n","enough, as you remember, to get from this bank \n","to the carrock by the ford, but on the other side \n","is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. i \n","had to walk miles before i found a place where \n","the river was wide and shallow enough for me \n","to wade and swim, and then miles back again \n","to pick up the tracks again. by that time it was \n","too late for me to follow them far. they went \n","straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on \n","the east side of the misty mountains, where we \n","had our pleasant little party with the wargs the \n","night before last. and now i think i have \n","answered your first question, too,\" ended \n","gandalf, and he sat a long while silent. \n","\n","bilbo thought he knew what the wizard \n","meant. \"what shall we do,\" he cried, \"if he leads \n","all the wargs and the goblins down here? we \n","\n","\n","\n","shall all be caught and killed! i thought you said \n","he was not a friend of theirs.\" \n","\n","\"so i did. and don't be silly! you had better \n","go to bed, your wits are sleepy.\" \n","\n","the hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there \n","seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; \n","and while the dwarves were still singing songs \n","he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little head \n","about beorn, till he dreamed a dream of \n","hundreds of black bears dancing slow heavy \n","dances round and round in the moonlight in the \n","courtyard. then he woke up when everyone \n","else was asleep, and he heard the same \n","scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as \n","before. \n","\n","next morning they were all wakened by \n","beorn himself. \"so here you all are still!\" he \n","said. he picked up the hobbit and laughed: \"not \n","eaten up by wargs or goblins or wicked bears \n","yet i see\"; and he poked mr. baggins' waistcoat \n","most disrespectfully. \"little bunny is getting nice \n","and fat again on bread and honey,\" he \n","chuckled. \"come and have some more!\" \n","\n","so they all went to breakfast with him. \n","beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he \n","seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and \n","set them all laughing with his funny stories; nor \n","did they have to wonder long where he had \n","been or why he was so nice to them, for he told \n","them himself. he had been over the river and \n","\n","\n","\n","right back up into the mountains - from which \n","you can guess that he could travel quickly, in \n","bear's shape at any rate. from the burnt wolf- \n","glade he had soon found out that part of their \n","story was true; but he had found more than that: \n","he had caught a warg and a goblin wandering \n","in the woods. from these he had got news: the \n","goblin patrols were still hunting with wargs for \n","the dwarves, and they were fiercely angry \n","because of the death of the great goblin, and \n","also because of the burning of the chief wolfs \n","nose and the death from the wizard's fire of \n","many of his chief servants. so much they told \n","him when he forced them, but he guessed there \n","was more wickedness than this afoot, and that \n","a great raid of the whole goblin army with their \n","wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the \n","mountains might soon be made to find the \n","dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and \n","creatures that lived there, and who they thought \n","must be sheltering them. \n","\n","\"it was a good story, that of yours,\" said \n","beorn, \"but i like it still better now i am sure it is \n","true. you must forgive my not taking your word. \n","if you lived near the edge of mirkwood, you \n","would take the word of no one that you did not \n","know as well as your brother or better. as it is, i \n","can only say that i have hurried home as fast as \n","i could to see that you were safe, and to offer \n","you any help that i can. i shall think more kindly \n","\n","\n","\n","of dwarves after this. killed the great goblin, \n","killed the great goblin!\" he chuckled fiercely to \n","himself. \n","\n","\"what did you do with the goblin and the \n","warg?\" asked bilbo suddenly. \n","\n","\"come and see!\" said beorn, and they \n","followed round the house. a goblin's head was \n","stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was \n","nailed to a tree just beyond. beorn was a fierce \n","enemy. but now he was their friend, and \n","gandalf thought it wise to tell him their whole \n","story and the reason of their journey, so that \n","they could get the most help he could offer. \n","\n","this is what he promised to do for them. he \n","would provide ponies for each of them, and a \n","horse for gandalf, for their journey to the forest, \n","and he would lade them with food to last them \n","for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as \n","easy as possible to carry - nuts, flour, sealed \n","jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of \n","honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep \n","good a long time, and on a little of which they \n","could march far. the making of these was one \n","of his secrets; but honey was in them, as in \n","most of his foods, and they were good to eat, \n","though they made one thirsty. water, he said, \n","they would not need to carry this side of the \n","forest, for there were streams and springs \n","along the road. \"but your way through mirkwood \n","is dark, dangerous and difficult,\" he said. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"water is not easy to find there, nor food. the \n","time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be \n","past and gone indeed before you get to the \n","other side), and nuts are about all that grows \n","there fit for food; in there the wild things are \n","dark, queer, and savage. i will provide you with \n","skins for carrying water, and i will give you \n","some bows and arrows. but i doubt very much \n","whether anything you find in mirkwood will be \n","wholesome to eat or to drink. there is one \n","stream there, i know, black and strong which \n","crosses the path. that you should neither drink \n","of, nor bathe in; for i have heard that it carries \n","enchantment and a great drowsiness and \n","forgetfulness. and in the dim shadows of that \n","place i don't think you will shoot anything, \n","wholesome or unwholesome, without straying \n","from the path. that you must not do, for any \n","reason. \n","\n","\"that is all the advice i can give you. \n","beyond the edge of the forest i cannot help you \n","much; you must depend on your luck and your \n","courage and the food i send with you. at the \n","gate of the forest i must ask you to send back \n","my horse and my ponies. but i wish you all \n","speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you \n","come back this way again.'' \n","\n","\n","they thanked him, of course, with many bows \n","\n","\n","\n","and sweepings of their hoods and with many an \n","\"at your service, o master of the wide wooden \n","halls!\" but their spirits sank at his grave words, \n","and they all felt that the adventure was far more \n","dangerous than they had thought, while all the \n","time, even if they passed all the perils of the \n","road, the dragon was waiting at the end. \n","\n","all that morning they were busy with \n","preparations. soon after midday they ate with \n","beorn for the last time, and after the meal they \n","mounted the steeds he was lending them, and \n","bidding him many farewells they rode off \n","through his gate at a good pace. \n","\n","as soon as they left his high hedges at the \n","east of his fenced lands they turned north and \n","then bore to the north-west. by his advice they \n","were no longer making for the main forest-road \n","to the south of his land. had they followed the \n","pass, their path would have led them down a \n","stream from the mountains that joined the great \n","river miles south of the carrock. at that point \n","there was a deep ford which they might have \n","passed, if they had still had their ponies, and \n","beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood \n","and to the entrance of the old forest road. but \n","beorn had warned them that that way was now \n","often used by the goblins, while the forest-road \n","itself, he had heard, was overgrown and \n","disused at the eastern end and led to \n","impassable marshes where the paths had long \n","\n","\n","\n","been lost. its eastern opening had also always \n","been far to the south of the lonely mountain, \n","and would have left them still with a long and \n","difficult northward march when they got to the \n","other side. north of the carrock the edge of \n","mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the \n","great river, and though here the mountains too \n","drew down nearer, beorn advised them to take \n","this way; for at a place a few days' ride due \n","north of the carrock was the gate of a little- \n","known pathway through mirkwood that led \n","almost straight towards the lonely mountain. \n","\n","\"the goblins,\" beorn had said, \"will not dare \n","to cross the great river for a hundred miles \n","north of the carrock nor to come near my house \n","- it is well protected at night! - but i should ride \n","fast; for if they make their raid soon they will \n","cross the river to the south and scour all the \n","edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and \n","wargs run swifter than ponies. still you are \n","safer going north, even though you seem to be \n","going back nearer to their strongholds; for that \n","is what they will least expect, and they will have \n","the longer ride to catch you. be off now as quick \n","as you may!\" \n","\n","that is why they were now riding in silence, \n","galloping wherever the ground was grassy and \n","smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, \n","and in the distance the line of the river with its \n","trees drawing ever closer. the sun had only just \n","\n","\n","\n","turned west when they started, and till evening it \n","lay golden on the land about them. it was \n","difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and \n","when they had put many miles between them \n","and beorn's house they began to talk and to \n","sing again and to forget the dark forest-path \n","that lay in front. but in the evening when the \n","dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains \n","glowered against the sunset they made a camp \n","and set a guard, and most of them slept \n","uneasily with dreams in which there came the \n","howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins. \n","\n","still the next morning dawned bright and fair \n","again. there was an autumn-like mist white \n","upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon \n","the sun rose red in the east and the mists \n","vanished, and while the shadows were still long \n","they were off again. so they rode now for two \n","more days, and all the while they saw nothing \n","save grass and flowers and birds and scattered \n","trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer \n","browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. \n","sometimes bilbo saw the horns of the harts \n","sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he \n","thought they were the dead branches of trees. \n","that third evening they were so eager to press \n","on, for beorn had said that they should reach \n","the forest-gate early on the fourth-day, that they \n","rode still forward after dusk and into the night \n","beneath the moon. as the light faded bilbo \n","\n","\n","\n","thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, \n","the shadowy form of a great bear prowling \n","along in the same direction. but if he dared to \n","mention it to gandalf, the wizard only said: \n","\"hush! take no notice!\" \n","\n","next day they started before dawn, though \n","their night had been short. as soon as it was \n","light they could see the forest coming as it were \n","to meet them, or waiting for them like a black \n","and frowning wall before them. the land began \n","to slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit \n","that a silence began to draw in upon them. \n","birds began to sing less. there were no more \n","deer; not even rabbits were to be seen. by the \n","afternoon they had reached the eaves of \n","mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the \n","great overhanging boughs of its outer trees. \n","their trunks were huge and gnarled, their \n","branches twisted, their leaves were dark and \n","long. ivy grew on them and trailed along the \n","ground. \n","\n","\"well, here is mirkwood!\" said gandalf. \n","\"the greatest of the forests of the northern \n","world. i hope you like the look of it. now you \n","must send back these excellent ponies you \n","have borrowed.\" \n","\n","the dwarves were inclined to grumble at \n","this, but the wizard told them they were fools. \n","\"beorn is not as far off as you seem to think, \n","and you had better keep your promises anyway, \n","\n","\n","\n","for he is a bad enemy. mr. baggins' eyes are \n","sharper than yours, if you have not seen each \n","night after dark a great bear going along with us \n","or sitting far off in the moon watching our \n","camps. not only to guard you and guide you, \n","but to keep an eye on the ponies too. beorn \n","may be your friend, but he loves his animals as \n","his children. you do not guess what kindness he \n","has shown you in letting dwarves ride them so \n","far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if \n","you tried to take them into the forest.\" \n","\n","\"what about the horse, then?\" said thorin. \n","\"you don't mention sending that back.\" \n","\n","\"i don't, because i am not sending it.\" \n","\n","\"what about your promise then?\" \n","\n","\"i will look after that. i am not sending the \n","horse back, i am riding it!\" \n","\n","then they knew that gandalf was going to \n","leave them at the very edge of mirkwood, and \n","they were in despair. but nothing they could say \n","would change his mind. \n","\n","\"now we had this all out before, when we \n","landed on the carrock,\" he said. \"it is no use \n","arguing. i have, as i told you, some pressing \n","business away south; and i am already late \n","through bothering with you people. we may \n","meet again before all is over, and then again of \n","course we may not. that depends on your luck \n","and on your courage and sense; and i am \n","sending mr. baggins with you. i have told you \n","\n","\n","\n","before that he has more about him than you \n","guess, and you will find that out before long. so \n","cheer up bilbo and don't look so glum. cheer \n","up thorin and company! this is your expedition \n","after all. think of the treasure at the end, and \n","forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until \n","tomorrow morning!\" \n","\n","when tomorrow morning came he still said \n","the same. so now there was nothing left to do \n","but to fill their water-skins at a clear spring they \n","found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the \n","ponies. they distributed the packages as fairly \n","as they could, though bilbo thought his lot was \n","wearisomely heavy, and did not at all like the \n","idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that \n","on his back. \n","\n","\"don't you worry!\" said thorin. \"it will get \n","lighter all too soon. before long i expect we \n","shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food \n","begins to run short.\" \n","\n","then at last they said good-bye to their \n","ponies and turned their heads for home. off \n","they trotted gaily, seeming very glad to put their \n","tails towards the shadow of mirkwood. as they \n","went away bilbo could have sworn that a thing \n","like a bear left the shadow of the trees and \n","shambled off quickly after them. \n","\n","now gandalf too said farewell. bilbo sat on \n","the ground feeling very unhappy and wishing he \n","was beside the wizard on his tall horse. he had \n","\n","\n","\n","gone just inside the forest after breakfast (a \n","very poor one), and it had seemed as dark in \n","there in the morning as at night, and very secret: \n","\"a sort of watching and waiting feeling,\" he said \n","to himself. \n","\n","\"good-bye!\" said gandalf to thorin. \"and \n","goodbye to you all, good-bye! straight through \n","the forest is your way now. don't stray off the \n","track! - if you do, it is a thousand to one you will \n","never find it again and never get out of \n","mirkwood; and then i don't suppose i, or any \n","one else, will ever see you again.\" \n","\n","\"do we really have to go through?\" groaned \n","the hobbit. \n","\n","\"yes, you do!\" said the wizard, \"if you want \n","to get to the other side. you must either go \n","through or give up your quest. and i am not \n","going to allow you to back out now, mr. \n","baggins. i am ashamed of you for thinking of it. \n","you have got to look after all these dwarves for \n","me,\" he laughed. \n","\n","\"no! no!\" said bilbo. \"i didn't mean that. i \n","meant, is there no way round?\" \n","\n","\"there is, if you care to go two hundred \n","miles or so out of your way north, and twice that \n","south. but you wouldn't get a safe path even \n","then. there are no safe paths in this part of the \n","world. remember you are over the edge of the \n","wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you \n","go. before you could get round mirkwood in the \n","\n","\n","\n","north you would be right among the slopes of \n","the grey mountains, and they are simply stiff \n","with goblins, hobgoblins, and ores of the worst \n","description. before you could get round it in the \n","south, you would get into the land of the \n","necromancer; and even you, bilbo, won't need \n","me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. i don't \n","advise you to go anywhere near the places \n","overlooked by his dark tower! stick to the \n","forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the \n","best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you \n","may come out one day and see the long \n","marshes lying below you, and beyond them, \n","high in the east, the lonely mountain where \n","dear old smaug lives, though i hope he is not \n","expecting you.\" \n","\n","\"very comforting you are to be sure,\" \n","growled thorin. \"good-bye! if you won't come \n","with us, you had better get off without any more \n","talk!\" \n","\n","\"good-bye then, and really good-bye!\" said \n","gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode \n","down into the west. but he could not resist the \n","temptation to have the last word. before he had \n","passed quite out of hearing he turned and put \n","his hands to his mouth and called to them. they \n","heard his voice come faintly: \"good-bye! be \n","good, take care of yourselves - and don't \n","leave the path!\" \n","\n","then he galloped away and was soon lost \n","\n","\n","\n","to sight. \"o good-bye and go away!\" grunted the \n","dwarves, all the more angry because they were \n","really filled with dismay at losing him. now \n","began the most dangerous part of all the \n","journey. they each shouldered the heavy pack \n","and the water-skin which was their share, and \n","turned from the light that lay on the lands \n","outside and plunged into the forest. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter viii \n","\n","\n","flies and spiders \n","\n","\n","they walked in single file. the entrance to the \n","path was like a sort of arch leading into a \n","gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that \n","leant together, too old and strangled with ivy \n","and hung with lichen to bear more than a few \n","blackened leaves. the path itself was narrow \n","and wound in and out among the trunks. soon \n","the light at the gate was like a little bright hole \n","far behind, and the quiet was so deep that their \n","feet seemed to thump along while all the trees \n","leaned over them and listened. \n","\n","as their eyes became used to the dimness \n","they could see a little way to either side in a sort \n","of darkened green glimmer. occasionally a \n","slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in \n","through some opening in the leaves far above, \n","and still more luck in not being caught in the \n","tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath, \n","stabbed down thin and bright before them. but \n","\n","\n","this was seldom, and it soon ceased altogether. \n","\n","there were black squirrels in the wood. as \n","bilbo's sharp inquisitive eyes got used to \n","seeing things he could catch glimpses of them \n","whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree- \n","trunks. there were queer noises too, grunts, \n","scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth, and \n","among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick \n","in places on the forest-floor; but what made the \n","noises he could not see. the nastiest things \n","they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense \n","cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick, \n","often stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in \n","the lower branches on either side of them. \n","there were none stretched across the path, but \n","whether because some magic kept it clear, or \n","for what other reason they could not guess. \n","\n","it was not long before they grew to hate the \n","forest as heartily as they had hated the tunnels \n","of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less \n","hope of any ending. but they had to go on and \n","on, long after they were sick for a sight of the \n","sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of \n","wind on their faces. there was no movement of \n","air down under the forest-roof, and it was \n","everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. even the \n","dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and \n","lived at times for long whiles without the light of \n","the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make \n","\n","\n","\n","a house in but not to spend summer days in, felt \n","that he was being slowly suffocated. \n","\n","the nights were the worst. it then became \n","pitch-dark - not what you call pitch-dark, but \n","really pitch: so black that you really could see \n","nothing. bilbo tried flapping his hand in front of \n","his nose, but he could not see it at all. well, \n","perhaps it is not true to say that they could see \n","nothing: they could see eyes. they slept all \n","closely huddled together, and took it in turns to \n","watch; and when it was bilbo's turn he would \n","see gleams in the darkness round them, and \n","sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green eyes \n","would stare at him from a little distance, and \n","then slowly fade and disappear and slowly \n","shine out again in another place. and \n","sometimes they would gleam down from the \n","branches just above him; and that was most \n","terrifying. but the eyes that he liked the least \n","were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. \"insect \n","eyes,\" he thought, \"not animal eyes, only they \n","are much too big.\" \n","\n","although it was not yet very cold, they tried \n","lighting watch-fires at night, but they soon gave \n","that up. it seemed to bring hundreds and \n","hundreds of eyes all round them, though the \n","creatures, whatever they were, were careful \n","never to let their bodies show in the little flicker \n","of the flames. worse still it brought thousands of \n","\n","\n","\n","dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big \n","as your hand, flapping and whirring round their \n","ears. they could not stand that, nor the huge \n","bats, black as a top-hat, either; so they gave up \n","fires and sat at night and dozed in the \n","enormous uncanny darkness. \n","\n","all this went on for what seemed to the \n","hobbit ages upon ages; and he was always \n","hungry, for they were extremely careful with their \n","provisions. even so, as days followed days, \n","and still the forest seemed just the same, they \n","began to get anxious. the food would not last \n","for ever: it was in fact already beginning to get \n","low. they tried shooting at the squirrels, and \n","they wasted many arrows before they managed \n","to bring one down on the path. but when they \n","roasted it, it proved horrible to taste, and they \n","shot no more squirrels. \n","\n","they were thirsty too, for they had none too \n","much water, and in all the time they had seen \n","neither spring nor stream. this was their state \n","when one day they found their path blocked by \n","a running water. it flowed fast and strong but not \n","very wide right across the way, and it was \n","black, or looked it in the gloom. it was well that \n","beorn had warned them against it, or they \n","would have drunk from it, whatever its colour, \n","and filled some of their emptied skins at its \n","bank. as it was they only thought of how to \n","\n","\n","\n","cross it without wetting themselves in its water. \n","there had been a bridge of wood across, but it \n","had rotted and fallen leaving only the broken \n","posts near the bank. \n","\n","bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering \n","forward cried: \"there is a boat against the far \n","bank! now why couldn't it have been this side!\" \n","\n","\"how far away do you think it is?\" asked \n","thorin, for by now they knew bilbo had the \n","sharpest eyes among them. \n","\n","\"not at all far. i shouldn't think above twelve \n","yards.\" \n","\n","\"twelve yards! i should have thought it was \n","thirty at least, but my eyes don't see as well as \n","they used a hundred years ago. still twelve \n","yards is as good as a mile. we can't jump it, \n","and we daren't try to wade or swim.\" \n","\n","\"can any of you throw a rope?\" \n","\n","\"what's the good of that? the boat is sure \n","to be tied up, even if we could hook it, which i \n","doubt.\" \n","\n","\"i don't believe it is tied,\" said bilbo, \"though \n","of course i can't be sure in this light; but it looks \n","to me as if it was just drawn up on the bank, \n","which is low just there where the path goes \n","down into the water.\" \n","\n","\"dori is the strongest, but fili is the \n","youngest and still has the best sight,\" said \n","thorin. \"come here fili, and see if you can see \n","\n","\n","\n","the boat mr. baggins is talking about.\" \n","\n","fili thought he could; so when he had stared \n","a long while to get an idea of the direction, the \n","others brought him a rope. they had several \n","with them, and on the end of the longest they \n","fastened one of the large iron hooks they had \n","used for catching their packs to the straps \n","about their shoulders. fili took this in his hand, \n","balanced it for a moment, and then flung it \n","across the stream. \n","\n","splash it fell in the water! \"not far enough!\" \n","said bilbo who was peering forward. \"a couple \n","of feet and you would have dropped it on to the \n","boat. try again. i don't suppose the magic is \n","strong enough to hurt you, if you just touch a bit \n","of wet rope.\" \n","\n","fili picked up the hook when he had drawn \n","it back, rather doubtfully all the same. this time \n","he threw it with great strength. \n","\n","\"steady!\" said bilbo, \"you have thrown it \n","right into the wood on the other side now. draw \n","it back gently.\" fili hauled the rope back slowly, \n","and after a while bilbo said: \"carefully! it is lying \n","on the boat; let's hope the hook will catch.\" \n","\n","it did. the rope went taut, and fili pulled in \n","vain. kili came to his help, and then oin and \n","gloin. they tugged and tugged, and suddenly \n","they all fell over on their backs. bilbo was on the \n","look out, however, caught the rope, and with a \n","\n","\n","\n","piece of stick fended off the little black boat as \n","it came rushing across the stream. \"help!\" he \n","shouted, and balin was just in time to seize the \n","boat before it floated off down the current. \n","\n","\"it was tied after all,\" said he, looking at the \n","snapped painter that was still dangling from it. \n","\"that was a good pull, my lads; and a good job \n","that our rope was the stronger.\" \n","\n","\"who'll cross first?\" asked bilbo. \n","\n","\"i shall,\" said thorin, \"and you will come with \n","me, and fili and balin. that's as many as the \n","boat will hold at a time. after that kili and oin \n","and gloin and dori; next ori and nori, bifur and \n","bofur; and last dwalin and bombur.\" \n","\n","\"i'm always last and i don't like it,\" said \n","bombur. \"it's somebody else's turn today.\" \n","\n","\"you should not be so fat. as you are, you \n","must be with the last and lightest boatload. \n","don't start grumbling against orders, or \n","something bad will happen to you.\" \n","\n","\"there aren't any oars. how are you going \n","to push the boat back to the far bank?\" asked \n","the hobbit. \n","\n","\"give me another length of rope and \n","another hook,\" said fili, and when they had got \n","it ready, he cast it into the darkness ahead and \n","as high as he could throw it. since it did not fall \n","down again, they saw that it must have stuck in \n","the branches. \"get in now,\" said fili, \"and one \n","\n","\n","\n","of you haul on the rope that is stuck in a tree on \n","the other side. one of the others must keep \n","hold of the hook we used at first, and when we \n","are safe on the other side he can hook it on, \n","and you can draw the boat back.\" \n","\n","in this way they were all soon on the far \n","bank safe across the enchanted stream. dwalin \n","had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on \n","his arm, and bombur (still grumbling) was \n","getting ready to follow, when something bad did \n","happen. there was a flying sound of hooves on \n","the path ahead. out of the gloom came \n","suddenly the shape of a flying deer, it charged \n","into the dwarves and bowled them over, then \n","gathered itself for a leap. high it sprang and \n","cleared the water with a mighty jump. but it did \n","not reach the other side in safety. thorin was \n","the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. \n","as soon as they had landed he had bent his \n","bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden \n","guardian of the boat appeared. now he sent a \n","swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. as it \n","reached the further bank it stumbled. the \n","shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the \n","sound of hooves quickly falter and then go still. \n","\n","before they could shout in praise of the \n","shot, however, a dreadful wail from bilbo put all \n","thoughts of venison out of their minds. \"bombur \n","has fallen in! bombur is drowning!\" he cried. it \n","\n","\n","\n","was only too true. bombur had only one foot on \n","the land when the hart bore down on him, and \n","sprang over him. he had stumbled, thrusting the \n","boat away from the bank, and then toppled \n","back into the dark water, his hands slipping off \n","the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat span \n","slowly off and disappeared. \n","\n","they could still see his hood above the \n","water when they ran to the bank. quickly, they \n","flung a rope with a hook towards him. his hand \n","caught it, and they pulled him to the shore. he \n","was drenched from hair to boots, of course, but \n","that was not the worst. when they laid him on \n","the bank he was already fast asleep, with one \n","hand clutching the rope so tight that they could \n","not get it from his grasp; and fast asleep he \n","remained in spite of all they could do. \n","\n","they were still standing over him, cursing \n","their ill luck, and bombur's clumsiness, and \n","lamenting the loss of the boat which made it \n","impossible for them to go back and look for the \n","hart, when they became aware of the dim \n","blowing of horns in the wood and the sound as \n","of dogs baying far off. then they all fell silent; \n","and as they sat it seemed they could hear the \n","noise of a great hunt going by to the north of the \n","path, though they saw no sign of it. \n","\n","there they sat for a long while and did not \n","dare to make a move. bombur slept on with a \n","\n","\n","\n","smile on his fat face, as if he no longer cared \n","for all the troubles that vexed them. suddenly on \n","the path ahead appeared some white deer, a \n","hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had \n","been dark. they glimmered in the shadows. \n","before thorin could cry out three of the dwarves \n","had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows \n","from their bows. none seemed to find their \n","mark. the deer turned and vanished in the trees \n","as silently as they had come, and in vain the \n","dwarves shot their arrows after them. \n","\n","\"stop! stop!\" shouted thorin; but it was too \n","late, the excited dwarves had wasted their last \n","arrows, and now the bows that beorn had given \n","them were useless. \n","\n","they were a gloomy party that night, and the \n","gloom gathered still deeper on them in the \n","following days. they had crossed the \n","enchanted stream; but beyond it the path \n","seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the \n","forest they could see no change. yet if they had \n","known more about it and considered the \n","meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had \n","appeared upon their path, they would have \n","known that they were at last drawing towards \n","the eastern edge, and would soon have come, \n","if they could have kept up their courage and \n","their hope, to thinner trees and places where \n","the sunlight came again. \n","\n","\n","\n","but they did not know this, and they were \n","burdened with the heavy body of bombur, which \n","they had to carry along with them as best they \n","could, taking the wearisome task in turns of four \n","each while the others shared their packs. if \n","these had not become all too light in the last few \n","days, they would never have managed it; but a \n","slumbering and smiling bombur was a poor \n","exchange for packs filled with food however \n","heavy. in a few days a time came when there \n","was practically nothing left to eat or to drink. \n","nothing wholesome could they see growing in \n","the wood, only funguses and herbs with pale \n","leaves and unpleasant smell. \n","\n","about four days from the enchanted stream \n","they came to a part where most of the trees \n","were beeches. they were at first inclined to be \n","cheered by the change, for here there was no \n","undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep. \n","there was a greenish light about them, and in \n","places they could see some distance to either \n","side of the path. yet the light only showed them \n","endless lines of straight grey trunks like the \n","pillars of some huge twilight hall. there was a \n","breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a \n","sad sound. a few leaves came rustling down to \n","remind them that outside autumn was coming \n","on. their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of \n","countless other autumns that drifted over the \n","\n","\n","\n","banks of the path from the deep red carpets of \n","the forest. \n","\n","still bombur slept and they grew very \n","weary. at times they heard disquieting laughter. \n","sometimes there was singing in the distance \n","too. the laughter was the laughter of fair voices \n","not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but \n","it sounded eerie and strange, and they were not \n","comforted, rather they hurried on from those \n","parts with what strength they had left. \n","\n","two days later they found their path going \n","downwards, and before long they were in a \n","valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth \n","of oaks. \n","\n","\"is there no end to this accursed forest?\" \n","said thorin. \"somebody must climb a tree and \n","see if he can get his head above the roof and \n","have a look round. the only way is to choose \n","the tallest tree that overhangs the path.\" \n","\n","of course \"somebody\" meant bilbo. they \n","chose him, because to be of any use the \n","climber must get his head above the topmost \n","leaves, and so he must be light enough for the \n","highest and slenderest branches to bear him. \n","poor mr. baggins had never had much practice \n","in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into \n","the lowest branches of an enormous oak that \n","grew right out into the path, and up he had to go \n","as best he could. he pushed his way through \n","\n","\n","\n","the tangled twigs with many a slap in the eye; \n","he was greened and grimed from the old bark \n","of the greater boughs; more than once he \n","slipped and caught himself just in time; and at \n","last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place \n","where there seemed to be no convenient \n","branches at all, he got near the top. all the time \n","he was wondering whether there were spiders \n","in the tree, and how he was going to get down \n","again (except by falling). \n","\n","in the end he poked his head above the roof \n","of leaves, and then he found spiders all right. \n","but they were only small ones of ordinary size, \n","and they were after the butterflies. bilbo's eyes \n","were nearly blinded by the light. he could hear \n","the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, \n","but he could not answer, only hold on and blink. \n","the sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long \n","while before he could bear it. when he could, \n","he saw all round him a sea of dark green, \n","ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there \n","were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. i \n","expect they were a kind of \"purple emperor\", a \n","butterfly that loves the tops of oak-woods, but \n","these were not purple at all, they were a dark \n","dark velvety black without any markings to be \n","seen. \n","\n","he looked at the \"black emperors\" for a \n","long time, and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in \n","\n","\n","\n","his hair and on his face; but at length the cries \n","of the dwarves, who were now simply stamping \n","with impatience down below, reminded him of \n","his real business. it was no good. gaze as \n","much as he might, he could see no end to the \n","trees and the leaves in any direction. his heart, \n","that had been lightened by the sight of the sun \n","and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: \n","there was no food to go back to down below. \n","\n","actually, as i have told you, they were not far \n","off the edge of the forest; and if bilbo had had \n","the sense to see it, the tree that he had \n","climbed, though it was tall in itself, was standing \n","near the bottom of a wide valley, so that from its \n","top the trees seemed to swell up all round like \n","the edges of a great bowl, and he could not \n","expect to see how far the forest lasted. still he \n","did not see this, and he climbed down full of \n","despair. he got to the bottom again at last, \n","scratched, hot, and miserable, and he could not \n","see anything in the gloom below when he got \n","there. his report soon made the others as \n","miserable as he was. \n","\n","\"the forest goes on for ever and ever and \n","ever in all directions! whatever shall we do? \n","and what is the use of sending a hobbit!\" they \n","cried, as if it was his fault. they did not care \n","tuppence about the butterflies, and were only \n","made more angry when he told them of the \n","\n","\n","\n","beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to \n","climb up and feel. \n","\n","\n","that night they ate their very last scraps and \n","crumbs of food; and next morning when they \n","woke the first thing they noticed was that they \n","were still gnawingly hungry, and the next thing \n","was that it was raining and that here and there \n","the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest \n","floor. that only reminded them that they were \n","also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to \n","relieve them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst \n","by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a \n","chance drip to fall on your tongue. the only \n","scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly \n","from bombur. \n","\n","he woke up suddenly and sat up scratching \n","his head. he could not make out where he was \n","at all, nor why he felt so hungry; for he had \n","forgotten everything that had happened since \n","they started their journey that may morning long \n","ago. the last thing that he remembered was the \n","party at the hobbit's house, and they had great \n","difficulty in making him believe their tale of all \n","the many adventures they had had since. \n","\n","when he heard that there was nothing to \n","eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt very weak \n","\n","\n","\n","and wobbly in the legs. \"why ever did i wake \n","up!\" he cried. \"i was having such beautiful \n","dreams. i dreamed i was walking in a forest \n","rather like this one, only lit with torches on the \n","trees and lamps swinging from the branches \n","and fires burning on the ground; and there was \n","a great feast going on, going on for ever. a \n","woodland king was there with a crown of \n","leaves, and there was a merry singing, and i \n","could not count or describe the things there \n","were to eat and drink.\" \n","\n","\"you need not try,\" said thorin. \"in fact if you \n","can't talk about something else, you had better \n","be silent. we are quite annoyed enough with \n","you as it is. if you hadn't waked up, we should \n","have left you to your idiotic dreams in the forest; \n","you are no joke to carry even after weeks of \n","short commons.\" \n","\n","there was nothing now to be done but to \n","tighten the belts round their empty stomachs, \n","and hoist their empty sacks and packs, and \n","trudge along the track without any great hope of \n","ever getting to the end before they lay down and \n","died of starvation. this they did all that day, \n","going very slowly and wearily; while bombur \n","kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him \n","and that he wanted to lie down and sleep. \n","\n","\"no you don't!\" they said. \"let your legs \n","take their share, we have carried you far \n","\n","\n","\n","enough.\" \n","\n","all the same he suddenly refused to go a \n","step further and flung himself on the ground. \"go \n","on, if you must,\" he said. \"i'm just going to lie \n","here and sleep and dream of food, if i can't get \n","it any other way. i hope i never wake up again.\" \n","\n","at that very moment balin, who was a little \n","way ahead, called out: \"what was that? i \n","thought i saw a twinkle of light in the forest.\" \n","\n","they all looked, and a longish way off, it \n","seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; \n","then another and another sprang out beside it. \n","even bombur got up, and they hurried along \n","then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. the \n","light was in front of them and to the left of the \n","path, and when at last they had drawn level with \n","it, it seemed plain that torches and fires were \n","burning under the trees, but a good way off their \n","track. \n","\n","\"it looks as if my dreams were coming true,\" \n","gasped bombur puffing up behind. he wanted \n","to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. \n","but the others remembered only too well the \n","warnings of the wizard and of beorn. \n","\n","\"a feast would be no good, if we never got \n","back alive from it,\" said thorin. \n","\n","\"but without a feast we shan't remain alive \n","much longer anyway,\" said bombur, and bilbo \n","heartily agreed with him. they argued about it \n","\n","\n","\n","backwards and forwards for a long while, until \n","they agreed at length to send out a couple of \n","spies, to creep near the lights and find out more \n","about them. but then they could not agree on \n","who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to \n","run the chance of being lost and never finding \n","his friends again. in the end, in spite of \n","warnings, hunger decided them, because \n","bombur kept on describing all the good things \n","that were being eaten, according to his dream, \n","in the woodland feast; so they all left the path \n","and plunged into the forest together. \n","\n","after a good deal of creeping and crawling \n","they peered round the trunks and looked into a \n","clearing where some trees had been felled and \n","the ground levelled. there were many people \n","there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green \n","and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the \n","felled trees in a great circle. there was a fire in \n","their midst and there were torches fastened to \n","some of the trees round about; but most \n","splendid sight of all: they were eating and \n","drinking and laughing merrily. \n","\n","the smell of the roast meats was so \n","enchanting that, without waiting to consult one \n","another, every one of them got up and \n","scrambled forwards into the ring with the one \n","idea of begging for some food. no sooner had \n","the first stepped into the clearing than all the \n","\n","\n","\n","lights went out as if by magic. somebody \n","kicked the fire and it went up in rockets of \n","glittering sparks and vanished. they were lost \n","in a completely lightless dark and they could not \n","even find one another, not for a long time at any \n","rate. after blundering frantically in the gloom, \n","falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and \n","shouting and calling till they must have waked \n","everything in the forest for miles, at last they \n","managed to gather themselves in a bundle and \n","count themselves by touch. by that time they \n","had, of course, quite forgotten in what direction \n","the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at \n","least till morning. \n","\n","there was nothing for it but to settle down \n","for the night where they were; they did not even \n","dare to search on the ground for scraps of food \n","for fear of becoming separated again. but they \n","had not been lying long, and bilbo was only just \n","getting drowsy, when dori, whose turn it was to \n","watch first, said in a loud whisper: \n","\n","\"the lights are coming out again over there, \n","and there are more than ever of them.\" \n","\n","up they all jumped. there, sure enough, not \n","far away were scores of twinkling lights, and \n","they heard the voices and the laughter quite \n","plainly. they crept slowly towards them, in a \n","single line, each touching the back of the one in \n","front. when they got near thorin said: \"no \n","\n","\n","\n","rushing forward this time! no one is to stir from \n","hiding till i say. i shall send mr. baggins alone \n","first to talk to them. they won't be frightened of \n","him - ('what about me of them?' thought bilbo) \n","- and any way i hope they won't do anything \n","nasty to him.\" \n","\n","when they got to the edge of the circle of \n","lights they pushed bilbo suddenly from behind. \n","before he had time to slip on his ring, he \n","stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire \n","and torches. it was no good. out went all the \n","lights again and complete darkness fell. \n","\n","if it had been difficult collecting themselves \n","before, it was far worse this time. and they \n","simply could not find the hobbit. every time they \n","counted themselves it only made thirteen. they \n","shouted and called: \"bilbo baggins! hobbit! \n","you dratted hobbit! hi! hobbit, confusticate you, \n","where are you?\" and other things of that sort, \n","but there was no answer. \n","\n","they were just giving up hope, when dori \n","stumbled across him by sheer luck. in the dark \n","he fell over what he thought was a log, and he \n","found it was the hobbit curled up fast asleep. it \n","took a deal of shaking to wake him, and when \n","he was awake he was not pleased at all. \n","\n","\"i was having such a lovely dream,\" he \n","grumbled, \"all about having a most gorgeous \n","dinner.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"good heavens! he has gone like bombur,\" \n","they said. \"don't tell us about dreams. dream- \n","dinners aren't any good, and we can't share \n","them.\" \n","\n","\"they are the best i am likely to get in this \n","beastly place,\" he muttered, as he lay down \n","beside the dwarves and tried to go back to \n","sleep and find his dream again. \n","\n","but that was not the last of the lights in the \n","forest. later when the night must have been \n","getting old, kili who was watching then, came \n","and roused them all again, saying: \n","\n","\"there's a regular blaze of light begun not \n","far away - hundreds of torches and many fires \n","must have been lit suddenly and by magic. and \n","hark to the singing and the harps!\" \n","\n","after lying and listening for a while, they \n","found they could not resist the desire to go \n","nearer and try once more to get help. up they \n","got again; and this time the result was \n","disastrous. the feast that they now saw was \n","greater and more magnificent than before; and \n","at the head of a long line of feasters sat a \n","woodland king with a crown of leaves upon his \n","golden hair, very much as bombur had \n","described the figure in his dream. the elvish \n","folk were passing bowls from hand to hand and \n","across the fires, and some were harping and \n","many were singing. their gleaming hair was \n","\n","\n","\n","twined with flowers; green and white gems \n","glinted on their collars and their belts; and their \n","faces and their songs were filled with mirth. \n","loud and clear and fair were those songs, and \n","out stepped thorin in to their midst. \n","\n","dead silence fell in the middle of a word. \n","out went all light. the fires leaped up in black \n","smokes. ashes and cinders were in the eyes of \n","the dwarves, and the wood was filled again with \n","their clamour and their cries. \n","\n","bilbo found himself running round and round \n","(as he thought) and calling and calling: \"dori, \n","nori, ori, oin, gloin, fili, kili, bombur, bifur, \n","bofur, dwalin, balin, thorin oakenshield,\" while \n","people he could not see or feel were doing the \n","same all round him (with an occasional \"bilbo!\" \n","thrown in). but the cries of the others got \n","steadily further and fainter, and though after a \n","while it seemed to him they changed to yells \n","and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at \n","last died right away, and he was left alone in \n","complete silence and darkness. \n","\n","\n","that was one of his most miserable moments. \n","but he soon made up his mind that it was no \n","good trying to do anything till day came with \n","some little light, and quite useless to go \n","\n","\n","\n","blundering about tiring himself out with no hope \n","of any breakfast to revive him. so he sat himself \n","down with his back to a tree, and not for the last \n","time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole \n","with its beautiful pantries. he was deep in \n","thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and \n","butter when he felt something touch him. \n","something like a strong sticky string was \n","against his left hand, and when he tried to move \n","he found that his legs were already wrapped in \n","the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell \n","over. \n","\n","then the great spider, who had been busy \n","tying him up while he dozed, came from behind \n","him and came at him. he could only see the \n","thing's eyes, but he could feel its hairy legs as it \n","struggled to wind its abominable threads round \n","and round him. it was lucky that he had come to \n","his senses in time. soon he would not have \n","been able to move at all. as it was, he had a \n","desperate fight before he got free. he beat the \n","creature off with his hands - it was trying to \n","poison him to keep him quiet, as small spiders \n","do to flies - until he remembered his sword and \n","drew it out. then the spider jumped back, and \n","he had time to cut his legs loose. after that it \n","was his turn to attack. the spider evidently was \n","not used to things that carried such stings at \n","their sides, or it would have hurried away \n","\n","\n","\n","quicker. bilbo came at it before it could \n","disappear and stuck it with his sword right in \n","the eyes. then it went mad and leaped and \n","danced and flung out its legs in horrible jerks, \n","until he killed it with another stroke; and then he \n","fell down and remembered nothing more for a \n","long while. \n","\n","there was the usual dim grey light of the \n","forest-day about him when he came to his \n","senses. the spider lay dead beside him, and \n","his sword-blade was stained black. somehow \n","the killing of the giant spider, all alone by \n","himself in the dark without the help of the wizard \n","or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great \n","difference to mr. baggins. he felt a different \n","person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of \n","an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on \n","the grass and put it back into its sheath. \n","\n","\"i will give you a name,\" he said to it, \"and i \n","shall call you sting.\" \n","\n","after that he set out to explore. the forest \n","was grim and silent, but obviously he had first of \n","all to look for his friends, who were not likely to \n","be very far off, unless they had been made \n","prisoners by the elves (or worse things). bilbo \n","felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a \n","long while wondering in what direction the path \n","lay, and in what direction he should go first to \n","look for the dwarves. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"o! why did we not remember beorn's \n","advice, and gandalfs!\" he lamented. \"what a \n","mess we are in now! we! i only wish it was i/ie: \n","it is horrible being all alone.\" \n","\n","in the end he made as good a guess as he \n","could at the direction from which the cries for \n","help had come in the night - and by luck (he \n","was born with a good share of it) he guessed \n","more or less right, as you will see. having made \n","up his mind he crept along as cleverly as he \n","could. hobbits are clever at quietness, \n","especially in woods, as i have already told you; \n","also bilbo had slipped on his ring before he \n","started. that is why the spiders neither saw nor \n","heard him coming. \n","\n","he had picked his way stealthily for some \n","distance, when he noticed a place of dense \n","black shadow ahead of him, black even for that \n","forest, like a patch of midnight that had never \n","been cleared away. as he drew nearer, he saw \n","that it was made by spider-webs one behind \n","and over and tangled with another. suddenly he \n","saw, too, that there were spiders huge and \n","horrible sitting in the branches above him, and \n","ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they \n","should discover him. standing behind a tree he \n","watched a group of them for some time, and \n","then in the silence and stillness of the wood he \n","realised that these loathsome creatures were \n","\n","\n","\n","speaking one to another. their voices were a \n","sort of thin creaking and hissing, but he could \n","make out many of the words that they said. \n","they were talking about the dwarves! \n","\n","\"it was a sharp struggle, but worth it,\" said \n","one. \"what nasty thick skins they have to be \n","sure, but i'll wager there is good juice inside.\" \n","\n","\"aye, they'll make fine eating, when they've \n","hung a bit,\" said another. \n","\n","\"don't hang 'em too long,\" said a third. \n","\"they're not as fat as they might be. been \n","feeding none too well of late, i should guess.\" \n","\n","\"kill 'em, i say,\" hissed a fourth; \"kill 'em \n","now and hang 'em dead for a while.\" \n","\n","\"they're dead now, i'll warrant,\" said the \n","first. \n","\n","\"that they are not. i saw one a-struggling \n","just now. just coming round again, i should say, \n","after a bee-autiful sleep. i'll show you.\" \n","\n","with that one of the fat spiders ran along a \n","rope till it came to a dozen bundles hanging in a \n","row from a high branch. bilbo was horrified, \n","now that he noticed them for the first time \n","dangling in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot \n","sticking out of the bottoms of some of the \n","bundles, or here and there the tip of a nose, or \n","a bit of beard or of a hood. \n","\n","to the fattest of these bundles the spider \n","went - \"it is poor old bombur, i'll bet,\" thought \n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo - and nipped hard at the nose that stuck \n","out. there was a muffled yelp inside, and a toe \n","shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard. \n","there was life in bombur still. there was a \n","noise like the kicking of a flabby football, and \n","the enraged spider fell off the branch, only \n","catching itself with its own thread just in time. \n","\n","the others laughed. \"you were quite right,\" \n","they said, \"the meat's alive and kicking!\" \n","\n","\"i'll soon put an end to that,\" hissed the \n","angry spider climbing back onto the branch. \n","\n","\n","bilbo saw that the moment had come when he \n","must do something. he could not get up at the \n","brutes and he had nothing to shoot with; but \n","looking about he saw that in this place there \n","were many stones lying in what appeared to be \n","a now dry little watercourse. bilbo was a pretty \n","fair shot with a stone, and it did not take him \n","long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that \n","fitted his hand cosily. as a boy he used to \n","practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits \n","and squirrels, and even birds, got out of his way \n","as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop; and \n","even grownup he had still spent a deal of his \n","time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the \n","wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of \n","\n","\n","\n","the aiming and throwing sort - indeed he could \n","do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings, \n","asking riddles and cooking, that i haven't had \n","time to tell you about. there is no time now. \n","while he was picking up stones, the spider had \n","reached bombur, and soon he would have \n","been dead. at that moment bilbo threw. the \n","stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it \n","dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the \n","ground, with all its legs curled up. \n","\n","the next stone went whizzing through a big \n","web, snapping its cords, and taking off the \n","spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. \n","after that there was a deal of commotion in the \n","spider-colony, and they forgot the dwarves for a \n","bit, i can tell you. they could not see bilbo, but \n","they could make a good guess at the direction \n","from which the stones were coming. as quick \n","as lightning they came running and swinging \n","towards the hobbit, flinging out their long \n","threads in all directions, till the air seemed full of \n","waving snares. \n","\n","bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a \n","different place. the idea came to him to lead \n","the furious spiders further and further away from \n","the dwarves, if he could; to make them curious, \n","excited and angry all at once. when about fifty \n","had gone off to the place where he had stood \n","before, he threw some more stones at these, \n","\n","\n","\n","and at others that had stopped behind; then \n","dancing among the trees he began to sing a \n","song to infuriate them and bring them all after \n","him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice. \n","\n","this is what he sang: \n","\n","\n","old fat spider spinning in a tree! \n","\n","old fat spider cant see me! \n","attercop! attercop! \n","\n","wont you stop, \n","\n","stop your spinning and look forme? \n","\n","\n","old tomnoddy, all big body, \n","\n","old tomnoddy cant spy me! \n","attercop! attercop! \n","\n","down you drop! \n","\n","youll never catch me up your tree! \n","\n","\n","not very good perhaps, but then you must \n","remember that he had to make it up himself, on \n","the spur of a very awkward moment. it did what \n","he wanted any way. as he sang he threw some \n","more stones and stamped. practically all the \n","spiders in the place came after him: some \n","\n","\n","\n","dropped to the ground, others raced along the \n","branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new \n","ropes across the dark spaces. they made for \n","his noise far quicker than he had expected. \n","they were frightfully angry. quite apart from the \n","stones no spider has ever liked being called \n","attercop, and tomnoddy of course is insulting \n","to anybody. \n","\n","off bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but \n","several of the spiders had run now to different \n","points in the glade where they lived, and were \n","busy spinning webs across all the spaces \n","between the tree-stems. very soon the hobbit \n","would be caught in a thick fence of them all \n","round him - that at least was the spiders' idea. \n","standing now in the middle of the hunting and \n","spinning insects bilbo plucked up his courage \n","and began a new song: \n","\n","\n","lazy lob and crazy cob \n","are weaving webs to wind me. \n","\n","i am far more sweet than other meat, \n","but still they cannot find me! \n","\n","\n","here am i, naughty little fly; \n","\n","\n","\n","you are fat and lazy. \n","\n","you cannot trap me, though you try, \n","in your cobwebs crazy. \n","\n","\n","with that he turned and found that the last \n","space between two tall trees had been closed \n","with a web - but luckily not a proper web, only \n","great strands of double-thick spider-rope run \n","hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to \n","trunk. out came his little sword. he slashed the \n","threads to pieces and went off singing. \n","\n","the spiders saw the sword, though i don't \n","suppose they knew what it was, and at once the \n","whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit \n","along the ground and the branches, hairy legs \n","waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes \n","popping, full of froth and rage. they followed \n","him into the forest until bilbo had gone as far as \n","he dared. then quieter than a mouse he stole \n","back. \n","\n","he had precious little time, he knew, before \n","the spiders were disgusted and came back to \n","their trees where the dwarves were hung. in the \n","meanwhile he had to rescue them. the worst \n","part of the job was getting up on to the long \n","branch where the bundles were dangling. i don't \n","suppose he would have managed it, if a spider \n","had not luckily left a rope hanging down; with its \n","\n","\n","\n","help, though it stuck to his hand and hurt him, he \n","scrambled up - only to meet an old slow wicked \n","fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to \n","guard the prisoners, and had been busy \n","pinching them to see which was the juiciest to \n","eat. it had thought of starting the feast while the \n","others were away, but mr. baggins was in a \n","hurry, and before the spider knew what was \n","happening it felt his sting and rolled off the \n","branch dead. \n","\n","bilbo's next job was to loose a dwarf. what \n","was he to do? if he cut the string which hung \n","him up, the wretched dwarf would tumble thump \n","to the ground a good way below. wriggling \n","along the branch (which made all the poor \n","dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit) he \n","reached the first bundle. \n","\n","\"fili or kili,\" he thought by the tip of a blue \n","hood sticking out at the top. \"most likely fili,\" he \n","thought by the tip of a long nose poking out of \n","the winding threads. he managed by leaning \n","over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that \n","bound him round, and then, sure enough, with a \n","kick and a struggle most of fili emerged. i am \n","afraid bilbo actually laughed at the sight of him \n","jerking his stiff arms and legs as he danced on \n","the spider-string under his armpits, just like one \n","of those funny toys bobbing on a wire. \n","\n","somehow or other fili was got on to the \n","\n","\n","\n","branch, and then he did his best to help the \n","hobbit, although he was feeling very sick and ill \n","from spider-poison, and from hanging most of \n","the night and the next day wound round and \n","round with only his nose to breathe through. it \n","took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of his \n","eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he \n","had to cut most of it off. well, between them \n","they started to haul up first one dwarf and then \n","another and slash them free. none of them \n","were better off than fili, and some of them were \n","worse. some had hardly been able to breathe \n","at all (long noses are sometimes useful you \n","see) and some had been more poisoned. \n","\n","in this way they rescued kili, bifur, bofur, \n","dori and nori. poor old bombur was so \n","exhausted - he was the fattest and had been \n","constantly pinched and poked - that he just \n","rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the \n","ground, fortunately on to leaves, and lay there. \n","but there were still five dwarves hanging at the \n","end of the branch when the spiders began to \n","come back, more full of rage than ever. \n","\n","bilbo immediately went to the end of the \n","branch nearest the tree-trunk and kept back \n","those that crawled up. he had taken off his ring \n","when he rescued fili and forgotten to put it on \n","again, so now they all began to splutter and \n","hiss: \n","\n","\n","\n","\"now we see you, you nasty little creature! \n","we will eat you and leave your bones and skin \n","hanging on a tree. ugh! he's got a sting has \n","he? well, we'll get him all the same, and then \n","we'll hang him head downwards for a day or \n","two.\" \n","\n","while this was going on, the other dwarves \n","were working at the rest of the captives, and \n","cutting at the threads with their knives. soon all \n","would be free, though it was not clear what \n","would happen after that. the spiders had \n","caught them pretty easily the night before, but \n","that had been unawares and in the dark. this \n","time there looked like being a horrible battle. \n","\n","suddenly bilbo noticed that some of the \n","spiders had gathered round old bombur on the \n","floor, and had tied him up again and were \n","dragging him away. he gave a shout and \n","slashed at the spiders in front of him. they \n","quickly gave way, and he scrambled and fell \n","down the tree right into the middle of those on \n","the ground. his little sword was something new \n","in the way of stings for them. how it darted to \n","and fro! it shone with delight as he stabbed at \n","them. half a dozen were killed before the rest \n","drew off and left bombur to bilbo. \n","\n","\"come down! come down!\" he shouted to \n","the dwarves on the branch. \"don't stay up there \n","and be netted!\" for he saw spiders swarming \n","\n","\n","\n","up all the neighbouring trees, and crawling \n","along the boughs above the heads of the \n","dwarves. \n","\n","down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or \n","dropped, eleven all in a heap, most of them very \n","shaky and little use on their legs. there they \n","were at last, twelve of them counting poor old \n","bombur, who was being propped up on either \n","side by his cousin bifur, and his brother bofur; \n","and bilbo was dancing about and waving his \n","sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were \n","goggling at them all round and about and \n","above. it looked pretty hopeless. \n","\n","then the battle began. some of the \n","dwarves had knives, and some had sticks, and \n","all of them could get at stones; and bilbo had \n","his elvish dagger. again and again the spiders \n","were beaten off, and many of them were killed. \n","but it could not go on for long. bilbo was nearly \n","tired out; only four of the dwarves were able to \n","stand firmly, and soon they would all be \n","overpowered like weary flies. already the \n","spiders were beginning to weave their webs all \n","round them again from tree to tree. \n","\n","in the end bilbo could think of no plan \n","except to let the dwarves into the secret of his \n","ring. he was rather sorry about it, but it could \n","not be helped. \n","\n","\"i am going to disappear,\" he said. \"i shall \n","\n","\n","\n","draw the spiders off, if i can; and you must keep \n","together and make in the opposite direction. to \n","the left there, that is more or less the way \n","towards the place where we last saw the elf- \n","fires.\" \n","\n","it was difficult to get them to understand, \n","what with their dizzy heads, and the shouts, and \n","the whacking of sticks and the throwing of \n","stones; but at last bilbo felt he could delay no \n","longer - the spiders were drawing their circle \n","ever closer. he suddenly slipped on his ring, \n","and to the great astonishment of the dwarves \n","he vanished. \n","\n","soon there came the sound of \"lazy lob\" \n","and \"attercop\" from among the trees away on \n","the right. that upset the spiders greatly. they \n","stopped advancing, and some went off in the \n","direction of the voice. \"attercop\" made them so \n","angry that they lost their wits. then balin, who \n","had grasped bilbo's plan better than the rest, \n","led an attack. the dwarves huddled together in \n","a knot, and sending a shower of stones they \n","drove at the spiders on the left, and burst \n","through the ring. away behind them now the \n","shouting and singing suddenly stopped. \n","\n","hoping desperately that bilbo had not been \n","caught the dwarves went on. not fast enough, \n","though. they were sick and weary, and they \n","could not go much better than a hobble and a \n","\n","\n","\n","wobble, though many of the spiders were close \n","behind. every now and then they had to turn and \n","fight the creatures that were overtaking them; \n","and already some spiders were in the trees \n","above them and throwing down their long \n","clinging threads. \n","\n","things were looking pretty bad again, when \n","suddenly bilbo reappeared, and charged into \n","the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the \n","side. \n","\n","\"go on! go on!\" he shouted. \"i will do the \n","stinging!\" \n","\n","and he did. he darted backwards and \n","forwards, slashing at spider-threads, hacking at \n","their legs, and stabbing at their fat bodies if \n","they came too near. the spiders swelled with \n","rage, and spluttered and frothed, and hissed \n","out horrible curses; but they had become \n","mortally afraid of sting, and dared not come \n","very near, now that it had come back. so curse \n","as they would, their prey moved slowly but \n","steadily away. it was a most terrible business, \n","and seemed to take hours. but at last, just when \n","bilbo felt that he could not lift his hand for a \n","single stroke more, the spiders suddenly gave it \n","up, and followed them no more, but went back \n","disappointed to their dark colony. \n","\n","the dwarves then noticed that they had \n","come to the edge of a ring where elf-fires had \n","\n","\n","\n","been. whether it was one of those they had \n","seen the night before, they could not tell. but it \n","seemed that some good magic lingered in such \n","spots, which the spiders did not like. at any rate \n","here the light was greener, and the boughs less \n","thick and threatening, and they had a chance to \n","rest and draw breath. \n","\n","there they lay for some time, puffing and \n","panting. but very soon they began to ask \n","questions. they had to have the whole \n","vanishing business carefully explained, and the \n","finding of the ring interested them so much that \n","for a while they forgot their own troubles. balin \n","in particular insisted on having the gollum story, \n","riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring \n","in its proper place. but after a time the light \n","began to fail, and then other questions were \n","asked. where were they, and where was their \n","path, and where was there any food, and what \n","were they going to do next? these questions \n","they asked over and over again, and it was \n","from little bilbo that they seemed to expect to \n","get the answers. from which you can see that \n","they had changed their opinion of mr. baggins \n","very much, and had begun to have a great \n","respect for him (as gandalf had said they \n","would). indeed they really expected him to think \n","of some wonderful plan for helping them, and \n","were not merely grumbling. they knew only too \n","\n","\n","\n","well that they would soon all have been dead, if \n","it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked \n","him many times. some of them even got up and \n","bowed right to the ground before him, though \n","they fell over with the effort, and could not get on \n","their legs again for some time. knowing the \n","truth about the vanishing did not lessen their \n","opinion of bilbo at all; for they saw that he had \n","some wits, as well as luck and a magic ring - \n","and all three are very useful possessions. in fact \n","they praised him so much that bilbo began to \n","feel there really was something of a bold \n","adventurer about himself after all, though he \n","would have felt a lot bolder still, if there had \n","been anything to eat. \n","\n","but there was nothing, nothing at all; and \n","none of them were fit to go and look for \n","anything, or to search for the lost path. the lost \n","path! no other idea would come into bilbo's \n","tired head. he just sat staring in front of him at \n","the endless trees; and after a while they all fell \n","silent again. all except balin. long after the \n","others had stopped talking and shut their eyes, \n","he kept on muttering and chuckling to himself. \n","\n","\"gollum! well i'm blest! so that's how he \n","sneaked past me, is it? now i know! just crept \n","quietly along did you, mr. baggins? buttons all \n","over the doorstep! good old bilbo - bilbo - \n","bilbo - bo - bo - bo - \" and then he fell asleep, \n","\n","\n","\n","and there was complete silence for a long \n","while. \n","\n","all of a sudden dwalin opened an eye, and \n","looked round at them. \"where is thorin?\" he \n","asked. \n","\n","it was a terrible shock. of course there were \n","only thirteen of them, twelve dwarves and the \n","hobbit. where indeed was thorin? they \n","wondered what evil fate had befallen him, \n","magic or dark monsters; and shuddered as \n","they lay lost in the forest. there they dropped off \n","one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of \n","horrible dreams, as evening wore to black \n","night; and there we must leave them for the \n","present, too sick and weary to set guards or to \n","take turns at watching. \n","\n","thorin had been caught much faster than \n","they had. you remember bilbo falling like a log \n","into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? \n","the next time it had been thorin who stepped \n","forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a \n","stone enchanted. all the noise of the dwarves \n","lost in the night, their cries as the spiders \n","caught them and bound them, and all the \n","sounds of the battle next day, had passed over \n","him unheard. then the wood-elves had come \n","to him, and bound him, and carried him away. \n","\n","the feasting people were wood-elves, of \n","course. these are not wicked folk. if they have a \n","\n","\n","\n","fault it is distrust of strangers. though their \n","magic was strong, even in those days they were \n","wary. they differed from the high elves of the \n","west, and were more dangerous and less wise. \n","for most of them (together with their scattered \n","relations in the hills and mountains) were \n","descended from the ancient tribes that never \n","went to faerie in the west. there the light- \n","elves and the deep-elves and the sea-elves \n","went and lived for ages, and grew fairer and \n","wiser and more learned, and invented their \n","magic and their cunning craft in the making of \n","beautiful and marvellous things, before some \n","came back into the wide world. in the wide \n","world the wood-elves lingered in the twilight of \n","our sun and moon, but loved best the stars; and \n","they wandered in the great forests that grew tall \n","in lands that are now lost. they dwelt most often \n","by the edges of the woods, from which they \n","could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run \n","over the open lands by moonlight or starlight; \n","and after the coming of men they took ever \n","more and more to the gloaming and the dusk. \n","still elves they were and remain, and that is \n","good people. \n","\n","in a great cave some miles within the edge \n","of mirkwood on its eastern side there lived at \n","this time their greatest king. before his huge \n","doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of \n","\n","\n","\n","the forest and flowed on and out into the \n","marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands. \n","this great cave, from which countless smaller \n","ones opened out on every side, wound far \n","underground and had many passages and wide \n","halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome \n","than any goblin-dwelling, and neither so deep \n","nor so dangerous. in fact the subjects of the \n","king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, \n","and had houses or huts on the ground and in \n","the branches. the beeches were their favourite \n","trees. the king's cave was his palace, and the \n","strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of \n","his people against their enemies. \n","\n","it was also the dungeon of his prisoners. so \n","to the cave they dragged thorin - not too gently, \n","for they did not love dwarves, and thought he \n","was an enemy. in ancient days they had had \n","wars with some of the dwarves, whom they \n","accused of stealing their treasure. it is only fair \n","to say that the dwarves gave a different \n","account, and said that they only took what was \n","their due, for the elf-king had bargained with \n","them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had \n","afterwards refused to give them their pay. if the \n","elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure, \n","especially for silver and white gems; and though \n","his hoard was rich, he was ever eager for more, \n","since he had not yet as great a treasure as \n","\n","\n","\n","other elf-lords of old. his people neither mined \n","nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother \n","much with trade or with tilling the earth. all this \n","was well known to every dwarf, though thorin's \n","family had had nothing to do with the old quarrel \n","i have spoken of. consequently thorin was \n","angry at their treatment of him, when they took \n","their spell off him and he came to his senses; \n","and also he was determined that no word of \n","gold or jewels should be dragged out of him. \n","\n","the king looked sternly on thorin, when he \n","was brought before him, and asked him many \n","questions. but thorin would only say that he \n","was starving. \n","\n","\"why did you and your folk three times try to \n","attack my people at their merrymaking?\" asked \n","the king. \n","\n","\"we did not attack them,\" answered thorin; \n","\"we came to beg, because we were starving.\" \n","\n","\"where are your friends now, and what are \n","they doing?\" \n","\n","\"i don't know, but i expect starving in the \n","forest.\" \n","\n","\"what were you doing in the forest?\" \n","\n","\"looking for food and drink, because we \n","were starving.\" \n","\n","\"but what brought you into the forest at all?\" \n","asked the king angrily. \n","\n","at that thorin shut his mouth and would not \n","\n","\n","\n","say another word. \n","\n","\"very well!\" said the king. \"take him away \n","and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to tell \n","the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.\" \n","\n","then the elves put thongs on him, and shut \n","him in one of the inmost caves with strong \n","wooden doors, and left him. they gave him \n","food and drink, plenty of both, if not very fine; for \n","wood-elves were not goblins, and were \n","reasonably well-behaved even to their worst \n","enemies, when they captured them. the giant \n","spiders were the only living things that they had \n","no mercy upon. \n","\n","there in the king's dungeon poor thorin lay; \n","and after he had got over his thankfulness for \n","bread and meat and water, he began to wonder \n","what had become of his unfortunate friends. it \n","was not very long before he discovered; but that \n","belongs to the next chapter and the beginning \n","of another adventure in which the hobbit again \n","showed his usefulness. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter ix \n","\n","\n","barrels out of bond \n","\n","\n","the day after the battle with the spiders bilbo \n","and the dwarves made one last despairing \n","effort to find a way out before they died of \n","hunger and thirst. they got up and staggered on \n","in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of \n","them guessed to be the one in which the path \n","lay; but they never found out if they were right. \n","such day as there ever was in the forest was \n","fading once more into the blackness of night, \n","when suddenly out sprang the light of many \n","torches all round them, like hundreds of red \n","stars. out leaped wood-elves with their bows \n","and spears and called the dwarves to halt. \n","\n","there was no thought of a fight. even if the \n","dwarves had not been in such a state that they \n","were actually glad to be captured, their small \n","knives, the only weapons they had, would have \n","been of no use against the arrows of the elves \n","that could hit a bird's eye in the dark. so they \n","simply stopped dead and sat down and waited \n","- all except bilbo, who popped on his ring and \n","\n","\n","slipped quickly to one side. that is why, when \n","the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one \n","behind the other, and counted them, they never \n","found or counted the hobbit. \n","\n","nor did they hear or feel him trotting along \n","well behind their torch-light as they led off their \n","prisoners into the forest. each dwarf was \n","blindfold, but that did not make much difference, \n","for even bilbo with the use of his eyes could not \n","see where they were going, and neither he nor \n","the others knew where they had started from \n","anyway. bilbo had all he could do to keep up \n","with the torches, for the elves were making the \n","dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and \n","weary as they were. the king had ordered them \n","to make haste. suddenly the torches stopped, \n","and the hobbit had just time to catch them up \n","before they began to cross the bridge. this was \n","the bridge that led across the river to the king's \n","doors. the water flowed dark and swift and \n","strong beneath; and at the far end were gates \n","before the mouth of a huge cave that ran into \n","the side of a steep slope covered with trees. \n","there the great beeches came right down to \n","the bank, till their feet were in the stream. \n","\n","across the bridge the elves thrust their \n","prisoners, but bilbo hesitated in the rear. he \n","did not at all like the look of the cavern-mouth, \n","and he only made up his mind not to desert his \n","friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of \n","the last elves, before the great gates of the king \n","\n","\n","\n","closed behind them with a clang. \n","\n","inside the passages were lit with red torch- \n","light, and the elf-guards sang as they marched \n","along the twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. \n","these were not like those of the goblin-cities; \n","they were smaller, less deep underground, and \n","filled with a cleaner air. in a great hall with pillars \n","hewn out of the living stone sat the elvenking on \n","a chair of carven wood. on his head was a \n","crown of berries and red leaves, for the autumn \n","was come again. in the spring he wore a crown \n","of woodland flowers. in his hand he held a \n","carven staff of oak. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the elvenking's gate. \n","\n","the prisoners were brought before him; and \n","though he looked grimly at them, he told his \n","men to unbind them, for they were ragged and \n","weary. \"besides they need no ropes in here,\" \n","said he. \"there is no escape from my magic \n","doors for those who are once brought inside.\" \n","\n","long and searchingly he questioned the \n","dwarves about their doings, and where they \n","were going to, and where they were coming \n","from; but he got little more news out of them \n","than out of thorin. they were surly and angry \n","and did not even pretend to be polite. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"what have we done, o king?\" said balin, \n","who was the eldest left. \"is it a crime to be lost \n","in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be \n","trapped by spiders? are the spiders your tame \n","beasts or your pets, if killing them makes you \n","angry?\" \n","\n","such a question of course made the king \n","angrier than ever, and he answered: \"it is a \n","crime to wander in my realm without leave. do \n","you forget that you were in my kingdom, using \n","the road that my people made? did you not \n","three times pursue and trouble my people in the \n","forest and rouse the spiders with your riot and \n","clamour? after all the disturbance you have \n","made i have a right to know what brings you \n","here, and if you will not tell me now, i will keep \n","you all in prison until you have learned sense \n","and manners!\" \n","\n","then he ordered the dwarves each to be \n","put in a separate cell and to be given food and \n","drink, but not to be allowed to pass the doors of \n","their little prisons, until one at least of them was \n","willing to tell him all he wanted to know. but he \n","did not tell them that thorin was also a prisoner \n","with him. it was bilbo who found that out. \n","\n","\n","poor mr. baggins - it was a weary long time \n","that he lived in that place all alone, and always \n","in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly \n","\n","\n","\n","daring to sleep, even tucked away in the \n","darkest and remotest corners he could find. for \n","something to do he took to wandering about the \n","elvenking's palace. magic shut the gates, but \n","he could sometimes get out, if he was quick. \n","companies of the wood-elves, sometimes with \n","the king at their head, would from time to time \n","ride out to hunt, or to other business in the \n","woods and in the lands to the east. then if \n","bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just \n","behind them; though it was a dangerous thing to \n","do. more than once he was nearly caught in the \n","doors, as they clashed together when the last \n","elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among \n","them because of his shadow (altogether thin \n","and wobbly as it was in torchlight), or for fear of \n","being bumped into and discovered. and when \n","he did go out, which was not very often, he did \n","no good. fie did not wish to desert the dwarves, \n","and indeed he did not know where in the world \n","to go without them. he could not keep up with \n","the hunting elves all the time they were out, so \n","he never discovered the ways out of the wood, \n","and was left to wander miserably in the forest, \n","terrified of losing himself, until a chance came \n","of returning. he was hungry too outside, for he \n","was no hunter; but inside the caves he could \n","pick up a living of some sort by stealing food \n","from store or table when no one was at hand. \n","\n","\"i am like a burglar that can't get away, but \n","must go on miserably burgling the same house \n","\n","\n","\n","day after day,\" he thought. \"this is the dreariest \n","and dullest part of all this wretched, tiresome, \n","uncomfortable adventure! i wish i was back in \n","my hobbit-hole by my own warm fireside with \n","the lamp shining!\" he often wished, too, that he \n","could get a message for help sent to the wizard, \n","but that of course was quite impossible; and he \n","soon realized that if anything was to be done, it \n","would have to be done by mr. baggins, alone \n","and unaided. \n","\n","eventually, after a week or two of this \n","sneaking sort of life, by watching and following \n","the guards and taking what chances he could, \n","he managed to find out where each dwarf was \n","kept. he found all their twelve cells in different \n","parts of the palace, and after a time he got to \n","know his way about very well. what was his \n","surprise one day to overhear some of the \n","guards talking and to learn that there was \n","another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep \n","dark place. he guessed at once, of course, that \n","that was thorin; and after a while he found that \n","his guess was right. at last after many \n","difficulties he managed to find the place when \n","no one was about, and to have a word with the \n","chief of the dwarves. \n","\n","thorin was too wretched to be angry any \n","longer at his misfortunes, and was even \n","beginning to think of telling the king all about his \n","treasure and his quest (which shows how low- \n","spirited he had become), when he heard \n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo's little voice at his keyhole. he could \n","hardly believe his ears. soon however he made \n","up his mind that he could not be mistaken, and \n","he came to the door and had a long whispered \n","talk with the hobbit on the other side. \n","\n","so it was that bilbo was able to take \n","secretly thorin's message to each of the other \n","imprisoned dwarves, telling them that thorin \n","their chief was also in prison close at hand, and \n","that no one was to reveal their errand to the \n","king, not yet, nor before thorin gave the word. \n","for thorin had taken heart again hearing how \n","the hobbit had rescued his companions from \n","the spiders, and was determined once more \n","not to ransom himself with promises to the king \n","of a share in the treasure, until all hope of \n","escaping in any other way had disappeared; \n","until in fact the remarkable mr. invisible baggins \n","(of whom he began to have a very high opinion \n","indeed) had altogether failed to think of \n","something clever. \n","\n","the other dwarves quite agreed when they \n","got the message. they all thought their own \n","shares in the treasure (which they quite \n","regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and \n","the still unconquered dragon) would suffer \n","seriously if the wood-elves claimed part of it, \n","and they all trusted bilbo. just what gandalf had \n","said would happen, you see. perhaps that was \n","part of his reason for going off and leaving \n","them. \n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so \n","hopeful as they did. he did not like being \n","depended on by everyone, and he wished he \n","had the wizard at hand. but that was no use: \n","probably all the dark distance of mirkwood lay \n","between them. he sat and thought and thought, \n","until his head nearly burst, but no bright idea \n","would come. one invisible ring was a very fine \n","thing, but it was not much good among fourteen. \n","but of course, as you have guessed, he did \n","rescue his friends in the end, and this is how it \n","happened. \n","\n","one day, nosing and wandering about, \n","bilbo discovered a very interesting thing: the \n","great gates were not the only entrance to the \n","caves. a stream flowed under part of the lowest \n","regions of the palace, and joined the forest \n","river some way further to the east, beyond the \n","steep slope out of which the main mouth \n","opened. where this underground watercourse \n","came forth from the hillside there was a water- \n","gate. there the rocky roof came down close to \n","the surface of the stream, and from it a \n","portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of \n","the river to prevent anyone coming in or out that \n","way. but the portcullis was often open, for a \n","good deal of traffic went out and in by the water- \n","gate. if anyone had come in that way, he would \n","have found himself in a dark rough tunnel \n","leading deep into the heart of the hill; but at one \n","point where it passed under the caves the roof \n","\n","\n","\n","had been cut away and covered with great \n","oaken trapdoors. these opened upwards into \n","the king's cellars. there stood barrels, and \n","barrels, and barrels; for the wood-elves, and \n","especially their king, were very fond of wine, \n","though no vines grew in those parts. the wine, \n","and other goods, were brought from far away, \n","from their kinsfolk in the south, or from the \n","vineyards of men in distant lands. \n","\n","hiding behind one of the largest barrels \n","bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use, \n","and lurking there, listening to the talk of the \n","king's servants, he learned how the wine and \n","other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to \n","the long lake. it seemed a town of men still \n","throve there, built out on bridges far into the \n","water as a protection against enemies of all \n","sorts, and especially against the dragon of the \n","mountain. from lake-town the barrels were \n","brought up the forest river. often they were \n","just tied together like big rafts and poled or \n","rowed up the stream; sometimes they were \n","loaded on to flat boats. \n","\n","when the barrels were empty the elves cast \n","them through the trapdoors, opened the water- \n","gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream, \n","bobbing along, until they were carried by the \n","current to a place far down the river where the \n","bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of \n","mirkwood. there they were collected and tied \n","together and floated back to lake-town, which \n","\n","\n","\n","stood close to the point where the forest river \n","flowed into the long lake. \n","\n","\n","for some time bilbo sat and thought about this \n","water-gate, and wondered if it could be used for \n","the escape of his friends, and at last he had the \n","desperate beginnings of a plan. \n","\n","the evening meal had been taken to the \n","prisoners. the guards were tramping away \n","down the passages taking the torchlight with \n","them and leaving everything in darkness. then \n","bilbo heard the king's butler bidding the chief of \n","the guards good-night. \n","\n","\"now come with me,\" he said, \"and taste \n","the new wine that has just come in. i shall be \n","hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the \n","empty wood, so let us have a drink first to help \n","the labour.\" \n","\n","\"very good,\" laughed the chief of the \n","guards. \"i'll taste with you, and see if it is fit for \n","the king's table. there is a feast tonight and it \n","would not do to send up poor stuff!\" \n","\n","\n","when he heard this bilbo was all in a flutter, for \n","he saw that luck was with him and he had a \n","chance at once to try his desperate plan. fie \n","followed the two elves, until they entered a small \n","cellar and sat down at a table on which two \n","\n","\n","\n","large flagons were set. soon they began to \n","drink and laugh merrily. luck of an unusual kind \n","was with bilbo then. it must be potent wine to \n","make a wood-elf drowsy; but this wine, it would \n","seem, was the heady vintage of the great \n","gardens of dorwinion, not meant for his \n","soldiers or his servants, but for the king's feasts \n","only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler's \n","great flagons. \n","\n","very soon the chief guard nodded his head, \n","then he laid it on the table and fell fast asleep. \n","the butler went on talking and laughing to \n","himself for a while without seeming to notice, \n","but soon his head too nodded to the table, and \n","he fell asleep and snored beside his friend. \n","then in crept the hobbit. very soon the chief \n","guard had no keys, but bilbo was trotting as \n","fast as he could along the passages towards \n","the cells. the great bunch seemed very heavy \n","to his arms, and his heart was often in his \n","mouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not \n","prevent the keys from making every now and \n","then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in \n","a tremble. \n","\n","first he unlocked balin's door, and locked it \n","again carefully as soon as the dwarf was \n","outside. balin was most surprised, as you can \n","imagine; but glad as he was to get out of his \n","wearisome little stone room, he wanted to stop \n","and ask questions, and know what bilbo was \n","going to do, and all about it. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"no time now!\" said the hobbit. \"you just \n","follow me! we must all keep together and not \n","risk getting separated. all of us must escape or \n","none, and this is our last chance. if this is found \n","out, goodness knows where the king will put you \n","next, with chains on your hands and feet too, i \n","expect. don't argue, there's a good fellow!\" \n","\n","then off he went from door to door, until his \n","following had grown to twelve - none of them \n","any too nimble, what with the dark, and what \n","with their long imprisonment. bilbo's heart \n","thumped every time one of them bumped into \n","another, or grunted or whispered in the dark. \n","\"drat this dwarvish racket!\" he said to himself. \n","but all went well, and they met no guards. as a \n","matter of fact there was a great autumn feast in \n","the woods that night, and in the halls above. \n","nearly all the king's folk were merrymaking. \n","\n","at last after much blundering they came to \n","thorin's dungeon, far down in a deep place and \n","fortunately not far from the cellars. \n","\n","\"upon my word!\" said thorin, when bilbo \n","whispered to him to come out and join his \n","friends, \"gandalf spoke true, as usual! a pretty \n","fine burglar you make, it seems, when the time \n","comes. i am sure we are all for ever at your \n","service, whatever happens after this. but what \n","comes next?\" \n","\n","bilbo saw that the time had come to explain \n","his idea, as far as he could; but he did not feel \n","at all sure how the dwarves would take it. his \n","\n","\n","\n","fears were quite justified, for they did not like it \n","a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of \n","their danger. \n","\n","\"we shall be bruised and battered to \n","pieces, and drowned too, for certain!\" they \n","muttered. \"we thought you had got some \n","sensible notion, when you managed to get hold \n","of the keys. this is a mad idea!\" \n","\n","\"very well!\" said bilbo very downcast, and \n","also rather annoyed. \"come along back to your \n","nice cells, and i will lock you all in again, and \n","you can sit there comfortably and think of a \n","better plan - but i don't suppose i shall ever get \n","hold of the keys again, even if i feel inclined to \n","try.\" \n","\n","that was too much for them, and they \n","calmed down. in the end, of course, they had to \n","do just what bilbo suggested, because it was \n","obviously impossible for them to try and find \n","their way into the upper halls, or to fight their \n","way out of gates that closed by magic; and it \n","was no good grumbling in the passages until \n","they were caught again. so following the hobbit, \n","down into the lowest cellars they crept. they \n","passed a door through which the chief guard \n","and the butler could be seen still happily snoring \n","with smiles upon their faces. the wine of \n","dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams. \n","there would be a different expression on the \n","face of the chief guard next day, even though \n","bilbo, before they went on, stole in and kind- \n","\n","\n","\n","heartedly put the keys back on his belt. \n","\n","\"that will save him some of the trouble he is \n","in for,\" said mr. baggins to himself. \"he wasn't \n","a bad fellow, and quite decent to the prisoners. \n","it will puzzle them all too. they will think we had \n","a very strong magic to pass through all those \n","locked doors and disappear. disappear! we \n","have got to get busy very quick, if that is to \n","happen!\" \n","\n","\n","balin was told off to watch the guard and the \n","butler and give warning if they stirred. the rest \n","went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. \n","there was little time to lose. before long, as \n","bilbo knew, some elves were under orders to \n","come down and help the butler get the empty \n","barrels through the doors into the stream. \n","these were in fact already standing in rows in \n","the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed off. \n","some of them were wine-barrels, and these \n","were not much use, as they could not easily be \n","opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor \n","could they easily be secured again. but among \n","them were several others, which had been used \n","for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all \n","sorts of things, to the king's palace. \n","\n","they soon found thirteen with room enough \n","for a dwarf in each. in fact some were too \n","roomy, and as they climbed in the dwarves \n","\n","\n","\n","thought anxiously of the shaking and the \n","bumping they would get inside, though bilbo did \n","his best to find straw and other stuff to pack \n","them in as cosily as could be managed in a \n","short time. at last twelve dwarves were stowed. \n","thorin had given a lot of trouble, and turned and \n","twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog \n","in a small kennel; while balin, who came last, \n","made a great fuss about his air-holes and said \n","he was stifling, even before his lid was on. bilbo \n","had done what he could to close holes in the \n","sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as \n","safely as could be managed, and now he was \n","left alone again, running round putting the \n","finishing touches to the packing, and hoping \n","against hope that his plan would come off. \n","\n","it had not been done a bit too soon. only a \n","minute or two after balin's lid had been fitted on \n","there came the sound of voices and the flicker \n","of lights. a number of elves came laughing and \n","talking into the cellars and singing snatches of \n","song. they had left a merry feast in one of the \n","halls and were bent on returning as soon as \n","they could. \n","\n","\"where's old galion, the butler?\" said one. \n","\"i haven't seen him at the tables tonight. he \n","ought to be here now to show us what is to be \n","done.\" \n","\n","\"i shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late,\" \n","said another. \"i have no wish to waste time \n","down here while the song is up!\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"ha, ha!\" came a cry. \"here's the old villain \n","with his head on a jug! he's been having a little \n","feast all to himself and his friend the captain.\" \n","\n","\"shake him! wake him!\" shouted the others \n","impatiently. \n","\n","galion was not at all pleased at being \n","shaken or wakened, and still less at being \n","laughed at. \"you're all late,\" he grumbled. \"here \n","am i waiting and waiting down here, while you \n","fellows drink and make merry and forget your \n","tasks. small wonder if i fall asleep from \n","weariness!\" \n","\n","\"small wonder,\" said they, \"when the \n","explanation stands close at hand in a jug! \n","come give us a taste of your sleeping-draught \n","before we fall to! no need to wake the turnkey \n","yonder. he has had his share by the looks of it.\" \n","\n","then they drank once round and became \n","mighty merry all of a sudden. but they did not \n","quite lose their wits. \"save us, galion!\" cried \n","some, \"you began your feasting early and \n","muddled your wits! you have stacked some full \n","casks here instead of the empty ones, if there is \n","anything in weight.\" \n","\n","\"get on with the work!\" growled the butler. \n","\"there is nothing in the feeling of weight in an \n","idle toss-pot's arms. these are the ones to go \n","and no others. do as i say!\" \n","\n","\"very well, very well,\" they answered rolling \n","the barrels to the opening. \"on your head be it, \n","if the king's full buttertubs and his best wine is \n","\n","\n","\n","pushed into the river for the lake-men to feast \n","on for nothing!\" \n","\n","\n","roll - roll - roll - roll, \n","roll -roll -rolling down the hole! \n","heave ho! splash plump! \n","\n","down they go, down they bump! \n","\n","\n","so they sang as first one barrel and then \n","another rumbled to the dark opening and was \n","pushed over into the cold water some feet \n","below. some were barrels really empty, some \n","were tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each; but \n","down they all went, one after another, with many \n","a clash and a bump, thudding on top of ones \n","below, smacking into the water, jostling against \n","the walls of the tunnel, knocking into one \n","another, and bobbing away down the current. \n","\n","it was just at this moment that bilbo \n","suddenly discovered the weak point in his plan. \n","most likely you saw it some time ago and have \n","been laughing at him; but i don't suppose you \n","would have done half as well yourselves in his \n","place. of course he was not in a barrel himself, \n","nor was there anyone to pack him in, even if \n","there had been a chance! it looked as if he \n","would certainly lose his friends this time (nearly \n","all of them had already disappeared through the \n","dark trap-door), and get utterly left behind and \n","\n","\n","\n","have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in \n","the elf-caves for ever. for even if he could have \n","escaped through the upper gates at once, he \n","had precious small chance of ever finding the \n","dwarves again. he did not know the way by \n","land to the place where the barrels were \n","collected. he wondered what on earth would \n","happen to them without him; for he had not had \n","time to tell the dwarves all that he had learned, \n","or what he had meant to do, once they were out \n","of the wood. \n","\n","while all these thoughts were passing \n","through his mind, the elves being very merry \n","began to sing a song round the river-door. \n","some had already gone to haul on the ropes \n","which pulled up the portcullis at the water-gate \n","so as to let out the barrels as soon as they were \n","all afloat below. \n","\n","\n","down the swift dark stream you go \n","back to lands you once did know/. \n","leave the halls and caverns deep, \n","leave the northern mountains steep, \n","where the forest wide and dim \n","stoops in shadow grey and grim! \n","float beyond the world of trees \n","out into the whispering breeze, \n","\n","past the rushes, past the reeds, \n","\n","past the marsh's waving weeds, \n","through the mist that riseth white \n","\n","\n","\n","up from mere and pool at night! \n","follovy follow stars that leap \n","up the heavens cold and steep; \n","turn when dawn comes overland, \n","over rapid, over sand, \n","\n","south away! and south away! \n","seek the sunlight and the day, \n","back to pasture, back to mead, \n","where the kine and oxen feed! \n","back to gardens on the hills \n","where the berry swells and fills \n","under sunlight, under day! \n","\n","south away! and south away! \n","down the swift dark stream you go \n","back to lands you once did know/. \n","\n","\n","now the very last barrel was being rolled to \n","the doors! in despair and not knowing what else \n","to do, poor little bilbo caught hold of it and was \n","pushed over the edge with it. down into the \n","water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water \n","with the barrel on top of him. \n","\n","he came up again spluttering and clinging \n","to the wood like a rat, but for all his efforts he \n","could not scramble on top. every time he tried, \n","the barrel rolled round and ducked him under \n","again. it was really empty, and floated light as a \n","cork. though his ears were full of water, he \n","could hear the elves still singing in the cellar \n","above. then suddenly the trap-doors fell to with \n","\n","\n","\n","a boom and their voices faded away. he was in \n","the dark tunnel floating in icy water, all alone - \n","for you cannot count friends that are all packed \n","up in barrels. \n","\n","very soon a grey patch came in the \n","darkness ahead. he heard the creak of the \n","water-gate being hauled up, and he found that \n","he was in the midst of a bobbing and bumping \n","mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to \n","pass under the arch and get out into the open \n","stream. he had as much as he could do to \n","prevent himself from being hustled and battered \n","to bits; but at last the jostling crowd began to \n","break up and swing off, one by one, under the \n","stony arch and away then he saw that it would \n","have been no good even if he had managed to \n","get astride his barrel, for there was no room to \n","spare, not even for a hobbit, between its top \n","and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate \n","was. \n","\n","\n","out they went under the overhanging branches \n","of the trees on either bank. bilbo wondered \n","what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot \n","of water was getting into their tubs. some of \n","those that bobbed along by him in the gloom \n","seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed \n","that these had dwarves inside. \n","\n","\"i do hope i put the lids on tight enough!\" he \n","\n","\n","\n","thought, but before long he was worrying too \n","much about himself to remember the dwarves. \n","he managed to keep his head above the water, \n","but he was shivering with the cold, and he \n","wondered if he would die of it before the luck \n","turned, and how much longer he would be able \n","to hang on, and whether he should risk the \n","chance of letting go and trying to swim to the \n","bank. \n","\n","the luck turned all right before long: the \n","eddying current carried several barrels close \n","ashore at one point and there for a while they \n","stuck against some hidden root. then bilbo \n","took the opportunity of scrambling up the side \n","of his barrel while it was held steady against \n","another. up he crawled like a drowned rat, and \n","lay on the top spread out to keep the balance \n","as best he could. the breeze was cold but \n","better than the water, and he hoped he would \n","not suddenly roll off again when they started off \n","once more. \n","\n","before long the barrels broke free again \n","and turned and twisted off down the stream, \n","and out into the main current. then he found it \n","quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared; \n","but he managed it somehow, though it was \n","miserably uncomfortable. luckily he was very \n","light, and the barrel was a good big one and \n","being rather leaky had now shipped a small \n","amount of water. all the same it was like trying \n","to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a round-bellied \n","\n","\n","\n","pony that was always thinking of rolling on the \n","grass. \n","\n","in this way at last mr. baggins came to a \n","place where the trees on either hand grew \n","thinner. he could see the paler sky between \n","them. the dark river opened suddenly wide, \n","and there it was joined to the main water of the \n","forest river flowing down in haste from the \n","king's great doors. there was a dim sheet of \n","water no longer overshadowed, and on its \n","sliding surface there were dancing and broken \n","reflections of clouds and of stars. then the \n","hurrying water of the forest river swept all the \n","company of casks and tubs away to the north \n","bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. this \n","had a shingly shore under hanging banks and \n","was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting \n","cape of hard rock. on the shallow shore most of \n","the barrels ran aground, though a few went on \n","to bump against the stony pier. \n","\n","there were people on the look-out on the \n","banks. they quickly poled and pushed all the \n","barrels together into the shallows, and when \n","they had counted them they roped them \n","together and left them till the morning. poor \n","dwarves! bilbo was not badly off now. he \n","slipped from his barrel and waded ashore, and \n","then sneaked along to some huts that he could \n","see near the water's edge. he no longer \n","thought twice about picking up a supper \n","uninvited if he got the chance, he had been \n","\n","\n","\n","obliged to do it for so long, and he knew now \n","only too well what it was to be really hungry, not \n","merely politely interested in the dainties of a \n","well-filled larder. also he had caught a glimpse \n","of a fire through the trees, and that appealed to \n","him with his dripping and ragged clothes \n","clinging to him cold and clammy. \n","\n","\n","there is no need to tell you much of his \n","adventures that night, for now we are drawing \n","near the end of the eastward journey and \n","coming to the last and greatest adventure, so \n","we must hurry on. of course helped by his \n","magic ring he got on very well at first, but he \n","was given away in the end by his wet footsteps \n","and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he \n","went or sat; and also he began to snivel, and \n","wherever he tried to hide he was found out by \n","the terrific explosions of his suppressed \n","sneezes. very soon there was a fine \n","commotion in the village by the riverside; but \n","bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf \n","and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did \n","not belong to him. the rest of the night he had \n","to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but \n","the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually \n","dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though \n","the yearwas getting late and the airwas chilly. \n","\n","he woke again with a specially loud \n","\n","\n","\n","sneeze. it was already grey morning, and there \n","was a merry racket down by the river. they \n","were making up a raft of barrels, and the raft- \n","elves would soon be steering it off down the \n","stream to lake-town. bilbo sneezed again. he \n","was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over. \n","he scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs \n","would take him and managed just in time to get \n","on to the mass of casks without being noticed \n","in the general bustle. luckily there was no sun \n","at the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for \n","a mercy he did not sneeze again for a good \n","while. \n","\n","there was a mighty pushing of poles. the \n","elves that were standing in the shallow water \n","heaved and shoved. the barrels now all lashed \n","together creaked and fretted. \n","\n","\"this is a heavy load!\" some grumbled. \n","\"they float too deep - some of these are never \n","empty. if they had come ashore in the daylight, \n","we might have had a look inside,\" they said. \n","\n","\"no time now!\" cried the raftman. \"shove \n","off!\" and off they went at last, slowly at first, until \n","they had passed the point of rock where other \n","elves stood to fend them off with poles, and \n","then quicker and quicker as they caught the \n","main stream and went sailing away down, down \n","towards the lake. \n","\n","they had escaped the dungeons of the king \n","and were through the wood, but whether alive or \n","dead still remains to be seen. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter x \n","\n","\n","a warm welcome \n","\n","\n","the day grew lighter and warmer as they \n","floated along. after a while the river rounded a \n","steep shoulder of land that came down upon \n","their left. under its rocky feet like an inland cliff \n","the deepest stream had flowed lapping and \n","bubbling. suddenly the cliff fell away. the \n","shores sank. the trees ended. then bilbo saw \n","a sight: \n","\n","the lands opened wide about him, filled \n","with the waters of the river which broke up and \n","wandered in a hundred winding courses, or \n","halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles \n","on every side; but still a strong water flowed on \n","steadily through the midst. and far away, its \n","dark head in a torn cloud, there loomed the \n","mountain! its nearest neighbours to the north- \n","east and the tumbled land that joined it to them \n","could not be seen. all alone it rose and looked \n","across the marshes to the forest. the lonely \n","\n","\n","mountain! bilbo had come far and through \n","many adventures to see it, and now he did not \n","like the look of it in the least. \n","\n","as he listened to the talk of the raftmen and \n","pieced together the scraps of information they \n","let fall, he soon realized that he was very \n","fortunate ever to have seen it at all, even from \n","this distance. dreary as had been his \n","imprisonment and unpleasant as was his \n","position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves \n","underneath him) still, he had been more lucky \n","than he had guessed. the talk was all of the \n","trade that came and went on the waterways and \n","the growth of the traffic on the river, as the \n","roads out of the east towards mirkwood \n","vanished or fell into disuse; and of the \n","bickerings of the lake-men and the wood- \n","elves about the upkeep of the forest river and \n","the care of the banks. those lands had \n","changed much since the days when dwarves \n","dwelt in the mountain, days which most people \n","now remembered only as a very shadowy \n","tradition. they had changed even in recent \n","years, and since the last news that gandalf had \n","had of them. great floods and rains had swollen \n","the waters that flowed east; and there had been \n","an earthquake or two (which some were \n","inclined to attribute to the dragon - alluding to \n","him chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in \n","\n","\n","\n","the direction of the mountain). the marshes and \n","bogs had spread wider and wider on either \n","side. paths had vanished, and many a rider and \n","wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost \n","ways across. the elf-road through the wood \n","which the dwarves had followed on the advice \n","of beorn now came to a doubtful and little used \n","end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the \n","river offered any longer a safe way from the \n","skirts of mirkwood in the north to the mountain- \n","shadowed plains beyond, and the river was \n","guarded by the wood-elves' king. \n","\n","so you see bilbo had come in the end by \n","the only road that was any good. it might have \n","been some comfort to mr. baggins shivering on \n","the barrels, if he had known that news of this \n","had reached gandalf far away and given him \n","great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing \n","his other business (which does not come into \n","this tale) and getting ready to come in search of \n","thorin's company. but bilbo did not know it. \n","\n","all he knew was that the river seemed to go \n","on and on and on for ever, and he was hungry, \n","and had a nasty cold in the nose, and did not \n","like the way the mountain seemed to frown at \n","him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. \n","after a while, however, the river took a more \n","southerly course and the mountain receded \n","again, and at last, late in the day the shores \n","\n","\n","\n","grew rocky, the river gathered all its wandering \n","waters together into a deep and rapid flood, \n","and they swept along at great speed. \n","\n","the sun had set when turning with another \n","sweep towards the east the forest-river rushed \n","into the long lake. there it had a wide mouth \n","with stony clifflike gates at either side whose \n","feet were piled with shingles. the long lake! \n","bilbo had never imagined that any water that \n","was not the sea could look so big. it was so \n","wide that the opposite shores looked small and \n","far, but it was so long that its northerly end, \n","which pointed towards the mountain, could not \n","be seen at all. only from the map did bilbo \n","know that away up there, where the stars of the \n","wain were already twinkling, the running river \n","came down into the lake from dale and with the \n","forest river filled with deep waters what must \n","once have been a great deep rocky valley. at \n","the southern end the doubled waters poured out \n","again over high waterfalls and ran away \n","hurriedly to unknown lands. in the still evening \n","air the noise of the falls could be heard like a \n","distant roar. \n","\n","not far from the mouth of the forest river \n","was the strange town he heard the elves speak \n","of in the king's cellars. it was not built on the \n","shore, though there were a few huts and \n","buildings there, but right out on the surface of \n","\n","\n","\n","the lake, protected from the swirl of the entering \n","river by a promontory of rock which formed a \n","calm bay. a great bridge made of wood ran out \n","to where on huge piles made of forest trees \n","was built a busy wooden town, not a town of \n","elves but of men, who still dared to dwell here \n","under the shadow of the distant dragon- \n","mountain. they still throve on the trade that \n","came up the great river from the south and was \n","carted past the falls to their town; but in the \n","great days of old, when dale in the north was \n","rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and \n","powerful, and there had been fleets of boats on \n","the waters, and some were filled with gold and \n","some with warriors in armour, and there had \n","been wars and deeds which were now only a \n","legend. the rotting piles of a greater town could \n","still be seen along the shores when the waters \n","sank in a drought. \n","\n","but men remembered little of all that, though \n","some still sang old songs of the dwarf-kings of \n","the mountain, thror and thrain of the race of \n","durin, and of the coming of the dragon, and the \n","fall of the lords of dale. some sang too that \n","thror and thrain would come back one day and \n","gold would flow in rivers, through the mountain- \n","gates, and all that land would be filled with new \n","song and new laughter. but this pleasant legend \n","did not much affect their daily business. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","as soon as the raft of barrels came in sight \n","boats rowed out from the piles of the town, and \n","voices hailed the raft-steerers. then ropes were \n","cast and oars were pulled, and soon the raft \n","was drawn out of the current of the forest river \n","and towed away round the high shoulder of rock \n","into the little bay of lake-town. there it was \n","moored not far from the shoreward head of the \n","great bridge. soon men would come up from \n","the south and take some of the casks away, \n","and others they would fill with goods they had \n","brought to be taken back up the stream to the \n","wood-elves' home. in the meanwhile the \n","barrels were left afloat while the elves of the raft \n","and the boatmen went to feast in lake-town. \n","\n","they would have been surprised, if they \n","could have seen what happened down by the \n","shore, after they had gone and the shades of \n","night had fallen. first of all a barrel was cut \n","loose by bilbo and pushed to the shore and \n","opened. groans came from inside, and out \n","crept a most unhappy dwarf. wet straw was in \n","his draggled beard; he was so sore and stiff, so \n","bruised and buffeted he could hardly stand or \n","\n","\n","stumble through the shallow water to lie \n","groaning on the shore. he had a famished and \n","a savage look like a dog that has been chained \n","and forgotten in a kennel for a week. it was \n","thorin, but you could only have told it by his \n","golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty \n","and tattered sky-blue hood with its tarnished \n","silver tassel. it was some time before he would \n","be even polite to the hobbit. \n","\n","\"well, are you alive or are you dead?\" \n","asked bilbo quite crossly. perhaps he had \n","forgotten that he had had at least one good \n","meal more than the dwarves, and also the use \n","of his arms and legs, not to speak of a greater \n","allowance of air. \"are you still in prison, or are \n","you free? if you want food, and if you want to go \n","on with this silly adventure - it's yours after all \n","and not mine - you had better slap your arms \n","and rub your legs and try and help me get the \n","others out while there is a chance!\" \n","\n","thorin of course saw the sense of this, so \n","after a few more groans he got up and helped \n","the hobbit as well as he could. in the darkness \n","floundering in the cold water they had a difficult \n","and very nasty job finding which were the right \n","barrels. knocking outside and calling only \n","discovered about six dwarves that could \n","answer. these were unpacked and helped \n","ashore where they sat or lay muttering and \n","\n","\n","\n","moaning; they were so soaked and bruised and \n","cramped that they could hardly yet realize their \n","release or be properly thankful for it. \n","\n","dwalin and balin were two of the most \n","unhappy, and it was no good asking them to \n","help. bifur and bofur were less knocked about \n","and drier, but they lay down and would do \n","nothing. fili and kili, however, who were young \n","(for dwarves) and had also been packed more \n","neatly with plenty of straw into smaller casks, \n","came out more or less smiling, with only a \n","bruise or two and a stiffness that soon wore off. \n","\n","\"i hope i never smell the smell of apples \n","again!\" said fili. \"my tub was full of it. to smell \n","apples everlastingly when you can scarcely \n","move and are cold and sick with hunger is \n","maddening. i could eat anything in the wide \n","world now, for hours on end - but not an apple!\" \n","\n","with the willing help of fili and kili, thorin \n","and bilbo at last discovered the remainder of \n","the company and got them out. poor fat \n","bombur was asleep or senseless; dori, nori, \n","ori, oin and gloin were waterlogged and \n","seemed only half alive; they all had to be \n","carried one by one and laid helpless on the \n","shore. \n","\n","\"well! here we are!\" said thorin. \"and i \n","suppose we ought to thank our stars and mr. \n","baggins. i am sure he has a right to expect it, \n","\n","\n","\n","though i wish he could have arranged a more \n","comfortable journey. still - all very much at your \n","service once more, mr. baggins. no doubt we \n","shall feel properly grateful, when we are fed and \n","recovered. in the meanwhile what next?\" \n","\n","\"i suggest lake-town,\" said bilbo. \"what \n","else is there?\" \n","\n","nothing else could, of course, be \n","suggested; so leaving the others thorin and fili \n","and kili and the hobbit went along the shore to \n","the great bridge. there were guards at the \n","head of it, but they were not keeping very \n","careful watch, for it was so long since there had \n","been any real need. except for occasional \n","squabbles about river-tolls they were friends \n","with the wood-elves. other folk were far away; \n","and some of the younger people in the town \n","openly doubted the existence of any dragon in \n","the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards \n","and gammers who said that they had seen him \n","flying in the sky in their young days. that being \n","so it is not surprising that the guards were \n","drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut, and \n","did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the \n","dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts. \n","their astonishment was enormous when thorin \n","oakenshield stepped in through the door. \n","\n","\"who are you and what do you want?\" they \n","shouted leaping to their feet and groping for \n","\n","\n","\n","weapons. \n","\n","\"thorin son of thrain son of thror king \n","under the mountain!\" said the dwarf in a loud \n","voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn \n","clothes and draggled hood. the gold gleamed \n","on his neck and waist; his eyes were dark and \n","deep. \"i have come back. i wish to see the \n","master of your town! \" \n","\n","then there was tremendous excitement. \n","some of the more foolish ran out of the hut as if \n","they expected the mountain to go golden in the \n","night and all the waters of the lake turn yellow \n","right away. the captain of the guard came \n","forward. \n","\n","\"and who are these?\" he asked, pointing to \n","fili and kili and bilbo. \n","\n","\"the sons of my father's daughter,\" \n","answered thorin, \"fili and kili of the race of \n","durin, and mr. baggins who has travelled with \n","us out of the west.\" \n","\n","\"if you come in peace lay down your arms!\" \n","said the captain. \n","\n","\"we have none,\" said thorin, and it was \n","true enough: their knives had been taken from \n","them by the wood-elves, and the great sword \n","orcrist too. bilbo had his short sword, hidden \n","as usual, but he said nothing about that. \"we \n","have no need of weapons, who return at last to \n","our own as spoken of old. nor could we fight \n","\n","\n","\n","against so many. take us to your master!\" \n","\n","\"he is at feast,\" said the captain. \n","\n","\"then all the more reason for taking us to \n","him,\" burst in fili, who was getting impatient at \n","these solemnities. \"we are worn and famished \n","after our long road and we have sick comrades. \n","now make haste and let us have no more \n","words, or your master may have something to \n","say to you.\" \n","\n","\"follow me then,\" said the captain, and with \n","six men about them he led them over the bridge \n","through the gates and into the market-place of \n","the town. this was a wide circle of quiet water \n","surrounded by the tall piles on which were built \n","the greater houses, and by long wooden quays \n","with many steps and ladders going down to the \n","surface of the lake. from one great hall shone \n","many lights and there came the sound of many \n","voices. they passed its doors and stood \n","blinking in the light looking at long tables filled \n","with folk. \n","\n","\"i am thorin son of thrain son of thror king \n","under the mountain! i return!\" cried thorin in a \n","loud voice from the door, before the captain \n","could say anything. \n","\n","all leaped to their feet. the master of the \n","town sprang from his great chair. but none rose \n","in greater surprise than the raft-men of the elves \n","who were sitting at the lower end of the hall. \n","\n","\n","\n","pressing forward before the master's table they \n","cried: \n","\n","\"these are prisoners of our king that have \n","escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that \n","could not give any good account of themselves, \n","sneaking through the woods and molesting our \n","people!\" \n","\n","\"is this true?\" asked the master. as a matter \n","of fact he thought it far more likely than the \n","return of the king under the mountain, if any \n","such person had ever existed. \n","\n","\"it is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by \n","the elvenking and imprisoned without cause as \n","we journeyed back to our own land,\" answered \n","thorin. \"but lock nor bar may hinder the \n","homecoming spoken of old. nor is this town in \n","the wood-elves' realm. i speak to the master of \n","the town of the men of the lake, not to the raft- \n","men of the king.\" \n","\n","then the master hesitated and looked from \n","one to the other. the elvenking was very \n","powerful in those parts and the master wished \n","for no enmity with him, nor did he think much of \n","old songs, giving his mind to trade and tolls, to \n","cargoes and gold, to which habit he owed his \n","position. others were of different mind, \n","however, and quickly the matter was settled \n","without him. the news had spread from the \n","doors of the hall like fire through all the town. \n","\n","\n","\n","people were shouting inside the hall and \n","outside it. the quays were thronged with \n","hurrying feet. some began to sing snatches of \n","old songs concerning the return of the king \n","under the mountain; that it was thror's \n","grandson not thror himself that had come back \n","did not bother them at all. others took up the \n","song and it rolled loud and high over the lake. \n","\n","\n","the king beneath the mountains, \n","the king of caive n stone, \n","\n","the lord of silver fountains \n","shall come into his ov\n","! \n","\n","\n","his crown shall be upholden, \n","his harp shall be restrung, \n","his halls shall echo golden \n","to songs of yore re-sung. \n","\n","\n","the mods shall wave on mountains \n","and grass beneath the sun; \n","\n","his wealth shall flowin fountains \n","and the rivers golden run. \n","\n","\n","\n","the streams shall run in gladness, \n","the lakes shall shine and burn, \n","all sorrowfail and sadness \n","at the mountain-king's return! \n","\n","\n","so they sang, or very like that, only there \n","was a great deal more of it, and there was \n","much shouting as well as the music of harps \n","and of fiddles mixed up with it. indeed such \n","excitement had not been known in the town in \n","the memory of the oldest grandfather. the \n","wood-elves themselves began to wonder \n","greatly and even to be afraid. they did not know \n","of course how thorin had escaped, and they \n","began to think their king might have made a \n","serious mistake. as for the master he saw there \n","was nothing else for it but to obey the general \n","clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to \n","pretend to believe that thorin was what he said. \n","so he gave up to him his own great chair and \n","set fili and kili beside him in places of honour. \n","even bilbo was given a seat at the high table, \n","and no explanation of where he came in - no \n","songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest \n","way - was asked for in the general bustle. \n","\n","soon afterwards the other dwarves were \n","brought into the town amid scenes of \n","\n","\n","\n","astonishing enthusiasm. they were all doctored \n","and fed and housed and pampered in the most \n","delightful and satisfactory fashion. a large \n","house was given up to thorin and his company; \n","boats and rowers were put at their service; and \n","crowds sat outside and sang songs all day, or \n","cheered if any dwarf showed so much as his \n","nose. \n","\n","some of the songs were old ones; but \n","some of them were quite new and spoke \n","confidently of the sudden death of the dragon \n","and of cargoes of rich presents coming down \n","the river to lake-town. these were inspired \n","largely by the master and they did not \n","particularly please the dwarves, but in the \n","meantime they were well contented and they \n","quickly grew fat and strong again. indeed within \n","a week they were quite recovered, fitted out in \n","fine cloth of their proper colours, with beards \n","combed and trimmed, and proud steps. thorin \n","looked and walked as if his kingdom was \n","already regained and smaug chopped up into \n","little pieces. \n","\n","then, as he had said, the dwarves' good \n","feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger \n","every day. there were no more groans or \n","grumbles. they drank his health, and they \n","patted him on the back, and they made a great \n","fuss of him; which was just as well, for he was \n","\n","\n","\n","not feeling particularly cheerful. he had not \n","forgotten the look of the mountain, nor the \n","thought of the dragon, and he had besides a \n","shocking cold. for three days he sneezed and \n","coughed, and he could not go out, and even \n","after that his speeches at banquets were \n","limited to \"thag you very buch.\" \n","\n","\n","in the meanwhile the wood-elves had gone \n","back up the forest river with their cargoes, \n","and there was great excitement in the king's \n","palace. i have never heard what happened to \n","the chief of the guards and the butler. nothing of \n","course was ever said about keys or barrels \n","while the dwarves stayed in lake-town, and \n","bilbo was careful never to become invisible. \n","still, i daresay, more was guessed than was \n","known, though doubtless mr. baggins remained \n","a bit of a mystery. in any case the king knew \n","now the dwarves' errand, or thought he did, and \n","he said to himself: \n","\n","\"very well! we'll see! no treasure will come \n","back through mirkwood without my having \n","something to say in the matter. but i expect they \n","will all come to a bad end, and serve them \n","right!\" he at any rate did not believe in dwarves \n","fighting and killing dragons like smaug, and he \n","\n","\n","\n","strongly suspected attempted burglary or \n","something like it - which shows he was a wise \n","elf and wiser than the men of the town, though \n","not quite right, as we shall see in the end. he \n","sent out his spies about the shores of the lake \n","and as far northward towards the mountain as \n","they would go, and waited. \n","\n","at the end of a fortnight thorin began to \n","think of departure. while the enthusiasm still \n","lasted in the town was the time to get help. it \n","would not do to let everything cool down with \n","delay. so he spoke to the master and his \n","\n","councillors and said that soon he and his \n","\n","company must go on towards the mountain. \n","\n","then for the first time the master was \n","surprised and a little frightened; and he \n","\n","wondered if thorin was after all really a \n","\n","descendant of the old kings. he had never \n","thought that the dwarves would actually dare to \n","approach smaug, but believed they were \n","frauds who would sooner or later be discovered \n","and be turned out. he was wrong. thorin, of \n","course, was really the grandson of the king \n","under the mountain, and there is no knowing \n","what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or \n","the recovery of his own. \n","\n","but the master was not sorry at all to let \n","them go. they were expensive to keep, and \n","their arrival had turned things into a long holiday \n","\n","\n","\n","in which business was at a standstill. \"let them \n","go and bother smaug, and see how he \n","welcomes them!\" he thought. \"certainly, o \n","thorin thrain's son thror's son!\" was what he \n","said. \"you must claim your own. the hour is at \n","hand, spoken of old. what help we can offer \n","shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude \n","when your kingdom is regained.\" \n","\n","so one day, although autumn was now \n","getting far on, and winds were cold, and leaves \n","were falling fast, three large boats left lake- \n","town, laden with rowers, dwarves, mr. baggins, \n","and many provisions. horses and ponies had \n","been sent round by circuitous paths to meet \n","them at their appointed landing-place. the \n","master and his councillors bade them farewell \n","from the great steps of the town-hall that went \n","down to the lake. people sang on the quays \n","and out of windows. the white oars dipped and \n","splashed, and off they went north up the lake on \n","the last stage of their long journey. the only \n","person thoroughly unhappy was bilbo. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter xi \n","\n","\n","on the doorstep \n","\n","\n","in two days going they rowed right up the long \n","lake and passed out into the river running, \n","and now they could all see the lonely mountain \n","towering grim and tall before them. the stream \n","was strong and their going slow. at the end of \n","the third day, some miles up the river, they drew \n","in to the left or western bank and disembarked. \n","here they were joined by the horses with other \n","provisions and necessaries and the ponies for \n","their own use that had been sent to meet them. \n","they packed what they could on the ponies and \n","the rest was made into a store under a tent, but \n","none of the men of the town would stay with \n","them even for the night so near the shadow of \n","the mountain. \n","\n","\"not at any rate until the songs have come \n","true!\" said they. it was easier to believe in the \n","dragon and less easy to believe in thorin in \n","these wild parts. indeed their stores had no \n","need of any guard, for all the land was desolate \n","and empty. so their escort left them, making off \n","swiftly down the river and the shoreward paths, \n","although the night was already drawing on. \n","\n","they spent a cold and lonely night and their \n","spirits fell. the next day they set out again. balin \n","and bilbo rode behind, each leading another \n","pony heavily laden beside him; the others were \n","some way ahead picking out a slow road, for \n","\n","\n","there were no paths. they made north-west, \n","slanting away from the river running, and \n","drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur \n","of the mountain that was flung out southwards \n","towards them. \n","\n","it was a weary journey, and a quiet and \n","stealthy one. there was no laughter or song or \n","sound of harps, and the pride and hopes which \n","had stirred in their hearts at the singing of old \n","songs by the lake died away to a plodding \n","gloom. they knew that they were drawing near \n","to the end of their journey, and that it might be a \n","very horrible end. the land about them grew \n","bleak and barren, though once, as thorin told \n","them, it had been green and fair. there was \n","little grass, and before long there was neither \n","bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened \n","stumps to speak of ones long vanished. they \n","were come to the desolation of the dragon, \n","and they were come at the waning of the year. \n","\n","\n","they reached the skirts of the mountain all the \n","same without meeting any danger or any sign of \n","the dragon other than the wilderness he had \n","made about his lair. the mountain lay dark and \n","silent before them and ever higher above them. \n","they made their first camp on the western side \n","of the great southern spur, which ended in a \n","height called ravenhill. on this there had been \n","an old watch-post; but they dared not climb it \n","yet, it was too exposed. \n","\n","before setting out to search the western \n","spurs of the mountain for the hidden door, on \n","which all their hopes rested, thorin sent out a \n","scouting expedition to spy out the land to the \n","south where the front gate stood. for this \n","\n","\n","\n","purpose he chose balin and fili and kili, and \n","with them went bilbo. they marched under the \n","grey and silent cliffs to the feet of ravenhill. \n","there the river, after winding a wide loop over \n","the valley of dale, turned from the mountain on \n","its road to the lake, flowing swift and noisily. its \n","bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above \n","the stream; and gazing out from it over the \n","narrow water, foaming and splashing among \n","many boulders, they could see in the wide valley \n","shadowed by the mountain's arms the grey \n","ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls. \n","\n","\"there lies all that is left of dale,\" said balin. \n","\"the mountain's sides were green with woods \n","and all the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in \n","the days when the bells rang in that town.\" he \n","looked both sad and grim as he said this: he \n","had been one of thorin's companions on the \n","day the dragon came. \n","\n","they did not dare to follow the river much \n","further towards the gate; but they went on \n","beyond the end of the southern spur, until lying \n","hidden behind a rock they could look out and \n","see the dark cavernous opening in a great cliff- \n","wall between the arms of the mountain. out of it \n","the waters of the running river sprang; and out \n","of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke. \n","nothing moved in the waste, save the vapour \n","and the water, and every now and again a black \n","and ominous crow. the only sound was the \n","sound of the stony water, and every now and \n","again the harsh croak of a bird. balin \n","shuddered. \n","\n","\"let us return!\" he said. \"we can do no \n","good here! and i don't like these dark birds, \n","they look like spies of evil.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the front gate. \n","\n","\n","\"the dragon is still alive and in the halls \n","under the mountain then - or i imagine so from \n","the smoke,\" said the hobbit. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"that does not prove it,\" said balin, \"though \n","i don't doubt you are right. but he might be gone \n","away some time, or he might be lying out on the \n","mountain-side keeping watch, and still i expect \n","smokes and steams would come out of the \n","gates: all the halls within must be filled with his \n","foul reek.\" \n","\n","\n","with such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by \n","croaking crows above them, they made their \n","weary way back to the camp. only in june they \n","had been guests in the fair house of elrond, and \n","though autumn was now crawling towards \n","winter that pleasant time now seemed years \n","ago. they were alone in the perilous waste \n","without hope of further help. they were at the \n","end of their journey, but as far as ever, it \n","seemed, from the end of their quest. none of \n","them had much spirit left. \n","\n","now strange to say mr. baggins had more \n","than the others. he would often borrow thorin's \n","map and gaze at it, pondering over the runes \n","and the message of the moon-letters elrond \n","had read. it was he that made the dwarves \n","begin the dangerous search on the western \n","slopes for the secret door. they moved their \n","camp then to a long valley, narrower than the \n","great dale in the south where the gates of the \n","river stood, and walled with lower spurs of the \n","mountain. two of these here thrust forward west \n","from the main mass in long steep-sided ridges \n","that fell ever downwards towards the plain. on \n","this western side there were fewer signs of the \n","dragon's marauding feet, and there was some \n","grass for their ponies. from this western camp, \n","shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun \n","\n","\n","\n","began to sink towards the forest, day by day \n","they toiled in parties searching for paths up the \n","mountain-side, if the map was true, somewhere \n","high above the cliff at the valley's head must \n","stand the secret door. day by day they came \n","back to their camp without success. \n","\n","but at last unexpectedly they found what \n","they were seeking. fili and kili and the hobbit \n","went back one day down the valley and \n","scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its \n","southern corner. about midday, creeping \n","behind a great stone that stood alone like a \n","pillar, bilbo came on what looked like rough \n","steps going upwards. following these excitedly \n","he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow \n","track, often lost, often rediscovered, that \n","wandered on to the top of the southern ridge \n","and brought them at last to a still narrower \n","ledge, which turned north across the face of the \n","mountain. looking down they saw that they \n","were at the top of the cliff at the valley's head \n","and were gazing down on to their own camp \n","below. silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their \n","right, they went in single file along the ledge, till \n","the wall opened and they turned into a little \n","steep-walled bay, grassy-floored, still and quiet. \n","its entrance which they had found could not be \n","seen from below because of the overhang of \n","the cliff, nor from further off because it was so \n","small that it looked like a dark crack and no \n","more. it was not a cave and was open to the sky \n","above; but at its inner end a flat wall rose up \n","that in the lower part, close to the ground, was \n","as smooth and upright as masons' work, but \n","without a joint or crevice to be seen. no sign \n","was there of post or lintel or threshold, nor any \n","sign of bar or bolt or key-hole; yet they did not \n","doubt that they had found the door at last. \n","\n","\n","\n","they beat on it, they thrust and pushed at it, \n","they implored it to move, they spoke fragments \n","of broken spells of opening, and nothing stirred. \n","at last tired out they rested on the grass at its \n","feet, and then at evening began their long climb \n","down. \n","\n","\n","there was excitement in the camp that night. in \n","the morning they prepared to move once more. \n","only bofur and bombur were left behind to \n","guard the ponies and such stores as they had \n","brought with them from the river. the others \n","went down the valley and up the newly found \n","path, and so to the narrow ledge. along this \n","they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow \n","and breathless was it, with a fall of a hundred \n","and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks \n","below; but each of them took a good coil of \n","rope wound tight about his waist, and so at last \n","without mishap they reached the little grassy \n","bay. \n","\n","there they made their third camp, hauling \n","up what they needed from below with their \n","ropes. down the same way they were able \n","occasionally to lower one of the more active \n","dwarves, such as kili, to exchange such news \n","as there was, or to take a share in the guard \n","below, while bofur was hauled up to the higher \n","camp. bombur would not come up either the \n","rope or the path. \n","\n","\"i am too fat for such fly-walks,\" he said. \"i \n","should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and \n","then you would be thirteen again. and the \n","knotted ropes are too slender for my weight.\" \n","luckily for him that was not true, as you will see. \n","\n","\n","\n","in the meanwhile some of them explored the \n","ledge beyond the opening and found a path that \n","led higher and higher on to the mountain; but \n","they did not dare to venture very far that way, \n","nor was there much use in it. out up there a \n","silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound \n","except that of the wind in the crannies of stone. \n","they spoke low and never called or sang, for \n","danger brooded in every rock. the others who \n","were busy with the secret of the door had no \n","more success. they were too eager to trouble \n","about the runes or the moon-letters, but tried \n","without resting to discover where exactly in the \n","smooth face of the rock the door was hidden. \n","they had brought picks and tools of many sorts \n","from lake-town, and at first they tried to use \n","these. but when they struck the stone the \n","handles splintered and jarred their arms cruelly, \n","and the steel heads broke or bent like lead. \n","mining work, they saw clearly, was no good \n","against the magic that had shut this door; and \n","they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise. \n","\n","bilbo found sitting on the doorstep \n","lonesome and wearisome - there was not a \n","doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call \n","the little grassy space between the wall and the \n","opening the \"doorstep\" in fun, remembering \n","bilbo's words long ago at the unexpected party \n","in his hobbit-hole, when he said they could sit \n","on the doorstep till they thought of something. \n","and sit and think they did, or wandered \n","aimlessly about, and glummer and glummer \n","they became. \n","\n","their spirits had risen a little at the \n","discovery of the path, but now they sank into \n","their boots; and yet they would not give it up and \n","go away. the hobbit was no longer much \n","\n","\n","\n","brighter than the dwarves. he would do nothing \n","but sit with his back to the rock-face and stare \n","away west through the opening, over the cliff, \n","over the wide lands to the black wall of \n","mirkwood, and to the distances beyond, in \n","which he sometimes thought he could catch \n","glimpses of the misty mountains small and far. if \n","the dwarves asked him what he was doing he \n","answered: \n","\n","\"you said sitting on the doorstep and \n","thinking would be my job, not to mention getting \n","inside, so i am sitting and thinking.\" but i am \n","afraid he was not thinking much of the job, but \n","of what lay beyond the blue distance, the quiet \n","western land and the hill and his hobbit-hole \n","under it. \n","\n","a large grey stone lay in the centre of the \n","grass and he stared moodily at it or watched \n","the great snails. they seemed to love the little \n","shut-in bay with its walls of cool rock, and there \n","were many of them of huge size crawling slowly \n","and stickily along its sides. \n","\n","\n","\"tomorrow begins the last week of autumn,\" \n","said thorin one day. \n","\n","\"and winter comes after autumn,\" said bifur. \n","\n","\"and next year after that,\" said dwalin, \"and \n","our beards will grow till they hang down the cliff \n","to the valley before anything happens here. \n","what is our burglar doing for us? since he has \n","got an invisible ring, and ought to be a specially \n","excellent performer now, i am beginning to think \n","he might go through the front gate and spy \n","things out a bit!\" \n","\n","bilbo heard this - the dwarves were on the \n","rocks just above the enclosure where he was \n","\n","\n","\n","sitting - and \"good gracious!\" he thought, \"so \n","that is what they are beginning to think, is it? it \n","is always poor me that has to get them out of \n","their difficulties, at least since the wizard left. \n","whatever am i going to do? i might have known \n","that something dreadful would happen to me in \n","the end. i don't think i could bear to see the \n","unhappy valley of dale again, and as for that \n","steaming gate! i i\" \n","\n","that night he was very miserable and hardly \n","slept. next day the dwarves all went wandering \n","off in various directions; some were exercising \n","the ponies down below, some were roving \n","about the mountain-side. all day bilbo sat \n","gloomily in the grassy bay gazing at the stone, \n","or out west through the narrow opening. he had \n","a queer feeling that he was waiting for \n","something. \"perhaps the wizard will suddenly \n","come back today,\" he thought. \n","\n","if he lifted his head he could see a glimpse \n","of the distant forest. as the sun turned west \n","there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as \n","if the light caught the last pale leaves. soon he \n","saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards \n","the level of his eyes. he went to the opening \n","and there pale and faint was a thin new moon \n","above the rim of earth. \n","\n","at that very moment he heard a sharp crack \n","behind him. there on the grey stone in the \n","grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal \n","black, its pale yellow breast freckled with dark \n","spots. crack! it had caught a snail and was \n","knocking it on the stone. crack! crack! \n","\n","suddenly bilbo understood. forgetting all \n","danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the \n","dwarves, shouting and waving. those that were \n","nearest came tumbling over the rocks and as \n","fast as they could along the ledge to him, \n","\n","\n","\n","wondering what on earth was the matter; the \n","others shouted to be hauled up the ropes \n","(except bombur, of course: he was asleep). \n","\n","quickly bilbo explained. they all fell silent: \n","the hobbit standing by the grey stone, and the \n","dwarves with wagging beards watching \n","impatiently. the sun sank lower and lower, and \n","their hopes fell. it sank into a belt of reddened \n","cloud and disappeared. the dwarves groaned, \n","but still bilbo stood almost without moving. the \n","little moon was dipping to the horizon. evening \n","was coming on. then suddenly when their hope \n","was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a \n","finger through a rent in the cloud. a gleam of \n","light came straight through the opening into the \n","bay and fell on the smooth rock-face. the old \n","thrush, who had been watching from a high \n","perch with beady eyes and head cocked on \n","one side, gave a sudden trill. there was a loud \n","crack. a flake of rock split from the wall and fell. \n","a hole appeared suddenly about three feet from \n","the ground. \n","\n","quickly, trembling lest the chance should \n","fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and \n","pushed - in vain. \n","\n","\"the key! the key!\" cried bilbo. \"where is \n","thorin?\" \n","\n","thorin hurried up. \n","\n","\"the key!\" shouted bilbo. \"the key that went \n","with the map! try it now while there is still time!\" \n","\n","then thorin stepped up and drew the key \n","on its chain from round his neck. he put it to the \n","hole. it fitted and it turned! snap! the gleam \n","went out, the sun sank, the moon was gone, and \n","evening sprang into the sky. \n","\n","now they all pushed together, and slowly a \n","part of the rock-wall gave way. long straight \n","cracks appeared and widened. a door five feet \n","\n","\n","\n","high and three broad was outlined, and slowly \n","without a sound swung inwards. it seemed as if \n","darkness flowed out like a vapour from the hole \n","in the mountain-side, and deep darkness in \n","which nothing could be seen lay before their \n","eyes, a yawning mouth leading in and down. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter xii \n","\n","\n","inside information \n","\n","\n","for a long time the dwarves stood in the dark \n","before the door and debated, until at last thorin \n","spoke: \n","\n","\"now is the time for our esteemed mr. \n","baggins, who has proved himself a good \n","companion on our long road, and a hobbit full of \n","courage and resource far exceeding his size, \n","and if i may say so possessed of good luck far \n","exceeding the usual allowance - now is the \n","time for him to perform the service for which he \n","was included in our company; now is the time \n","for him to earn his reward.\" \n","\n","you are familiar with thorin's style on \n","important occasions, so i will not give you any \n","more of it, though he went on a good deal \n","longer than this. it certainly was an important \n","occasion, but bilbo felt impatient. by now he \n","was quite familiar with thorin too, and he knew \n","what he was driving at. \n","\n","\n","\"if you mean you think it is my job to go into \n","the secret passage first, o thorin thrain's son \n","oakenshield, may your beard grow ever \n","longer,\" he said crossly, \"say so at once and \n","have done! i might refuse. i have got you out of \n","two messes already, which were hardly in the \n","original bargain, so that i am, i think, already \n","owed some reward. but 'third time pays for all' \n","as my father used to say, and somehow i don't \n","think i shall refuse. perhaps i have begun to \n","trust my luck more than i used to in the old \n","days\" - he meant last spring before he left his \n","own house, but it seemed centuries ago - \"but \n","anyway i think i will go and have a peep at once \n","and get it over. now who is coming with me?\" \n","\n","he did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so \n","he was not disappointed. fili and kili looked \n","uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the \n","others made no pretence of offering - except \n","old balin, the lookout man, who was rather fond \n","of the hobbit. he said he would come inside at \n","least and perhaps a bit of the way too, ready to \n","call for help if necessary. \n","\n","the most that can be said for the dwarves \n","is this: they intended to pay bilbo really \n","handsomely for his services; they had brought \n","him to do a nasty job for them, and they did not \n","mind the poor little fellow doing it if he would; \n","but they would all have done their best to get \n","\n","\n","\n","him out of trouble, if he got into it, as they did in \n","the case of the trolls at the beginning of their \n","adventures before they had any particular \n","reasons for being grateful to him. there it is: \n","dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with \n","a great idea of the value of money; some are \n","tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; \n","some are not, but are decent enough people \n","like thorin and company, if you don't expect \n","too much. \n","\n","\n","the stars were coming out behind him in a pale \n","sky barred with black when the hobbit crept \n","through the enchanted door and stole into the \n","mountain. it was far easier going than he \n","expected. this was no goblin entrance, or \n","rough wood-elves' cave. it was a passage \n","made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth \n","and skill: straight as a ruler, smooth-floored and \n","smooth-sided, going with a gentle never-varying \n","slope direct - to some distant end in the \n","blackness below. \n","\n","after a while balin bade bilbo \"good luck!\" \n","and stopped where he could still see the faint \n","outline of the door, and by a trick of the echoes \n","of the tunnel hear the rustle of the whispering \n","voices of the others just outside. then the \n","\n","\n","\n","hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the \n","echoes to take more than hobbit's care to \n","make no sound, he crept noiselessly down, \n","down, down into the dark. he was trembling \n","with fear, but his little face was set and grim. \n","already he was a very different hobbit from the \n","one that had run out without a pocket- \n","handkerchief from bag-end long ago. he had \n","not had a pocket-handkerchief for ages. he \n","loosened his dagger in its sheath, tightened his \n","belt, and went on. \n","\n","\n","\"now you are in for it at last, bilbo baggins,\" he \n","said to himself. \"you went and put your foot right \n","in it that night of the party, and now you have got \n","to pull it out and pay for it! dear me, what a fool \n","i was and am!\" said the least tookish part of \n","him. \"i have absolutely no use for dragon- \n","guarded treasures, and the whole lot could stay \n","here for ever, if only i could wake up and find \n","this beastly tunnel was my own front-hall at \n","home!\" \n","\n","he did not wake up of course, but went still \n","on and on, till all sign of the door behind had \n","faded away. he was altogether alone. soon he \n","thought it was beginning to feel warm. \"is that a \n","kind of a glow i seem to see coming right \n","\n","\n","\n","ahead down there?\" he thought. \n","\n","it was. as he went forward it grew and grew, \n","till there was no doubt about it. it was a red light \n","steadily getting redder and redder. also it was \n","now undoubtedly hot in the tunnel. wisps of \n","vapour floated up and past him and he began to \n","sweat. a sound, too, began to throb in his ears, \n","a sort of bubbling like the noise of a large pot \n","galloping on the fire, mixed with a rumble as of \n","a gigantic tom-cat purring. this grew to the \n","unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast \n","animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red \n","glow in front of him. \n","\n","it was at this point that bilbo stopped. \n","going on from there was the bravest thing he \n","ever did. the tremendous things that happened \n","afterwards were as nothing compared to it. he \n","fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before \n","he ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait. at \n","any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you \n","can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, \n","an opening of much the same size and shape \n","as the door above. through it peeps the \n","hobbit's little head. before him lies the great \n","bottom-most cellar or dungeon-hall of the \n","ancient dwarves right at the mountain's root. it \n","is almost dark so that its vastness can only be \n","dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of \n","the rocky floor there is a great glow. the glow of \n","\n","\n","\n","smaug! \n","\n","\n","there he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast \n","asleep; a thrumming came from his jaws and \n","nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were \n","low in slumber. beneath him, under all his limbs \n","and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all \n","sides stretching away across the unseen floors, \n","lay countless piles of precious things, gold \n","wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and \n","silver red-stained in the ruddy light. \n","\n","smaug lay, with wings folded like an \n","immeasurable bat, turned partly on one side, so \n","that the hobbit could see his underparts and his \n","long pale belly crusted with gems and \n","fragments of gold from his long lying on his \n","costly bed. behind him where the walls were \n","nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail, \n","helms and axes, swords and spears hanging; \n","and there in rows stood great jars and vessels \n","filled with a wealth that could not be guessed. \n","\n","to say that bilbo's breath was taken away \n","is no description at all. there are no words left \n","to express his staggerment, since men \n","changed the language that they learned of elves \n","in the days when all the world was wonderful. \n","bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards \n","\n","\n","\n","before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of \n","such treasure had never yet come home to him. \n","his heart was filled and pierced with \n","enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; \n","and he gazed motionless, almost forgetting the \n","frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and \n","count. \n","\n","\n","he gazed for what seemed an age, before \n","drawn almost against his will, he stole from the \n","shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the \n","nearest edge of the mounds of treasure. above \n","him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace \n","even in his sleep. he grasped a great two- \n","handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and \n","cast one fearful eye upwards. smaug stirred a \n","wing, opened a claw, the rumble of his snoring \n","changed its note. \n","\n","then bilbo fled. but the dragon did not \n","wake - not yet - but shifted into other dreams of \n","greed and violence, lying there in his stolen hall \n","while the little hobbit toiled back up the long \n","tunnel. his heart was beating and a more \n","fevered shaking was in his legs than when he \n","was going down, but still he clutched the cup, \n","and his chief thought was: \"i've done it! this will \n","show them. 'more like a grocer than a burglar' \n","\n","\n","\n","indeed! well, we'll hear no more of that.\" \n","\n","nor did he. balin was overjoyed to see the \n","hobbit again, and as delighted as he was \n","surprised. he picked bilbo up and carried him \n","out into the open air. it was midnight and clouds \n","had covered the stars, but bilbo lay with his \n","eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the \n","feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing \n","the excitement of the dwarves, or how they \n","praised him and patted him on the back and put \n","themselves and all their families for generations \n","to come at his service. \n","\n","\n","the dwarves were still passing the cup from \n","hand to hand and talking delightedly of the \n","recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast \n","rumbling woke in the mountain underneath as if \n","it was an old volcano that had made up its mind \n","to start eruptions once again. the door behind \n","them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from \n","closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel \n","came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the \n","depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that \n","made the ground beneath them tremble. \n","\n","then the dwarves forgot their joy and their \n","confident boasts of a moment before and \n","cowered down in fright. smaug was still to be \n","\n","\n","\n","reckoned with. it does not do to leave a live \n","dragon out of your calculations, if you live near \n","him. dragons may not have much real use for \n","all their wealth, but they know it to an ounce as a \n","rule, especially after long possession; and \n","smaug was no exception. he had passed from \n","an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether \n","insignificant in size but provided with a bitter \n","sword and great courage, figured most \n","unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to \n","wide waking. there was a breath of strange air \n","in his cave. could there be a draught from that \n","little hole? he had never felt quite happy about \n","it, though it was so small, and now he glared at \n","it in suspicion and wondered why he had never \n","blocked it up. of late he had half fancied he had \n","caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound \n","from far above that came down through it to his \n","lair. he stirred and stretched forth his neck to \n","sniff. then he missed the cup! \n","\n","thieves! fire! murder! such a thing had not \n","happened since first he came to the mountain! \n","his rage passes description - the sort of rage \n","that is only seen when rich folk that have more \n","than they can enjoy suddenly lose something \n","that they have long had but have never before \n","used or wanted. his fire belched forth, the hall \n","smoked, he shook the mountain-roots. he thrust \n","his head in vain at the little hole, and then \n","\n","\n","\n","coiling his length together, roaring like thunder \n","underground, he sped from his deep lair \n","through its great door, out into the huge \n","passages of the mountain-palace and up \n","towards the front gate. \n","\n","to hunt the whole mountain till he had \n","caught the thief and had torn and trampled him \n","was his one thought. he issued from the gate, \n","the waters rose in fierce whistling steam, and \n","up he soared blazing into the air and settled on \n","the mountain-top in a spout of green and scarlet \n","flame. the dwarves heard the awful rumour of \n","his flight, and they crouched against the walls of \n","the grassy terrace cringing under boulders, \n","hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of \n","the hunting dragon. \n","\n","there they would have all been killed, if it \n","had not been for bilbo once again. \"quick! \n","quick!\" he gasped. \"the door! the tunnel! it's \n","no good here.\" \n","\n","roused by these words they were just \n","about to creep inside the tunnel when bifur \n","gave a cry: \"my cousins! bombur and bofur - \n","we have forgotten them, they are down in the \n","valley!\" \n","\n","\"they will be slain, and all our ponies too, \n","and all our stores lost,\" moaned the others. \"we \n","can do nothing.\" \n","\n","\"nonsense!\" said thorin, recovering his \n","\n","\n","\n","dignity. \"we cannot leave them. get inside mr. \n","baggins and balin, and you two fili and kili - \n","the dragon shan't have all of us. now you \n","others, where are the ropes? be quick!\" \n","\n","those were perhaps the worst moments \n","they had been through yet. the horrible sounds \n","of smaug's anger were echoing in the stony \n","hollows far above; at any moment he might \n","come blazing down or fly whirling round and find \n","them there, near the perilous cliffs edge hauling \n","madly on the ropes. up came bofur, and still all \n","was safe. up came bombur, puffing and \n","blowing while the ropes creaked, and still all \n","was safe. up came some tools and bundles of \n","stores, and then danger was upon them. \n","\n","a whirring noise was heard. a red light \n","touched the points of standing rocks. the \n","dragon came. \n","\n","they had barely time to fly back to the \n","tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, \n","when smaug came hurtling from the north, \n","licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating \n","his great wings with a noise like a roaring wind. \n","his hot breath shrivelled the grass before the \n","door, and drove in through the crack they had \n","left and scorched them as they lay hid. \n","flickering fires leaped up and black rock- \n","shadows danced. then darkness fell as he \n","passed again. the ponies screamed with \n","\n","\n","\n","terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. \n","the dragon swooped and turned to pursue \n","them, and was gone. \n","\n","\"that'll be the end of our poor beasts!\" said \n","thorin. \"nothing can escape smaug once he \n","sees it. here we are and here we shall have to \n","stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long \n","open miles back to the river with smaug on the \n","watch!\" \n","\n","it was not a pleasant thought! they crept \n","further down the tunnel, and there they lay and \n","shivered though it was warm and stuffy, until \n","dawn came pale through the crack of the door. \n","every now and again through the night they \n","could hear the roar of the flying dragon grow \n","and then pass and fade, as he hunted round \n","and round the mountain-sides. \n","\n","he guessed from the ponies, and from the \n","traces of the camps he had discovered, that \n","men had come up from the river and the lake \n","and had scaled the mountain-side from the \n","valley where the ponies had been standing; but \n","the door withstood his searching eye, and the \n","little high-walled bay had kept out his fiercest \n","flames. long he had hunted in vain till the dawn \n","chilled his wrath and he went back to his golden \n","couch to sleep - and to gather new strength. he \n","would not forget or forgive the theft, not if a \n","thousand years turned him to smouldering \n","\n","\n","\n","stone, but he could afford to wait. slow and \n","silent he crept back to his lair and half closed \n","his eyes. \n","\n","when morning came the terror of the \n","dwarves grew less. they realized that dangers \n","of this kind were inevitable in dealing with such \n","a guardian, and that it was no good giving up \n","their quest yet. nor could they get away just \n","now, as thorin had pointed out. their ponies \n","were lost or killed, and they would have to wait \n","some time before smaug relaxed his watch \n","sufficiently for them to dare the long way on foot. \n","luckily they had saved enough of their stores to \n","last them still for some time. \n","\n","they debated long on what was to be done, \n","but they could think of no way of getting rid of \n","smaug - which had always been a weak point \n","in their plans, as bilbo felt inclined to point out. \n","then as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly \n","perplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit, \n","blaming him for what had at first so pleased \n","them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up \n","smaug's wrath so soon. \n","\n","\"what else do you suppose a burglar is to \n","do?\" asked bilbo angrily. \"i was not engaged to \n","kill dragons, that is warrior's work, but to steal \n","treasure. i made the best beginning i could. did \n","you expect me to trot back with the whole hoard \n","of thror on my back? if there is any grumbling to \n","\n","\n","\n","be done, i think i might have a say. you ought to \n","have brought five hundred burglars not one. i \n","am sure it reflects great credit on your \n","grandfather, but you cannot pretend that you \n","ever made the vast extent of his wealth clear to \n","me. i should want hundreds of years to bring it \n","all up, if i was fifty times as big, and smaug as \n","tame as a rabbit.\" \n","\n","after that of course the dwarves begged his \n","pardon. \"what then do you propose we should \n","do, mr. baggins?\" asked thorin politely. \n","\n","\"i have no idea at the moment - if you mean \n","about removing the treasure. that obviously \n","depends entirely on some new turn of luck and \n","the getting rid of smaug. getting rid of dragons \n","is not at all in my line, but i will do my best to \n","think about it. personally i have no hopes at all, \n","and wish i was safe back at home.\" \n","\n","\"never mind that for the moment! what are \n","we to do now, to-day?\" \n","\n","\"well, if you really want my advice, i should \n","say we can do nothing but stay where we are. \n","by day we can no doubt creep out safely \n","enough to take the air. perhaps before long one \n","or two could be chosen to go back to the store \n","by the river and replenish our supplies. but in \n","the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside \n","the tunnel by night. \n","\n","\"now i will make you an offer. i have got my \n","\n","\n","\n","ring and will creep down this very noon - then if \n","ever smaug ought to be napping - and see \n","what he is up to. perhaps something will turn \n","up. 'every worm has his weak spot,' as my \n","father used to say, though i am sure it was not \n","from personal experience.\" \n","\n","naturally the dwarves accepted the offer \n","eagerly. already they had come to respect little \n","bilbo. now he had become the real leader in \n","their adventure. he had begun to have ideas \n","and plans of his own. when midday came he \n","got ready for another journey down into the \n","mountain. he did not like it of course, but it was \n","not so bad now he knew, more or less, what \n","was in front of him. had he known more about \n","dragons and their wily ways, he might have \n","been more frightened and less hopeful of \n","catching this one napping. \n","\n","the sun was shining when he started, but it \n","was as dark as night in the tunnel. the light from \n","the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went \n","down. so silent was his going that smoke on a \n","gentle wind could hardly have surpassed it, and \n","he was inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as \n","he drew near the lower door. there was only the \n","veryfaintestglowto be seen. \n","\n","\"old smaug is weary and asleep,\" he \n","thought. \"he can't see me and he won't hear \n","me. cheer up bilbo!\" he had forgotten or had \n","\n","\n","\n","never heard about dragons' sense of smell. it is \n","also an awkward fact that they can keep half an \n","eye open watching while they sleep, if they are \n","suspicious. \n","\n","smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost \n","dead and dark, with scarcely a snore more than \n","a whiff of unseen steam, when bilbo peeped \n","once more from the entrance. he was just about \n","to step out on to the floor when he caught a \n","sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under \n","the drooping lid of smaug's left eye. he was \n","only pretending to sleep! he was watching the \n","tunnel entrance! hurriedly bilbo stepped back \n","and blessed the luck of his ring. then smaug \n","spoke. \n","\n","\n","\"well, thief! i smell you and i feel your air. i hear \n","your breath. come along! help yourself again, \n","there is plenty and to spare!\" \n","\n","but bilbo was not quite so unlearned in \n","dragon-lore as all that, and if smaug hoped to \n","get him to come nearer so easily he was \n","disappointed. \"no thank you, o smaug the \n","tremendous!\" he replied. \"i did not come for \n","presents. i only wished to have a look at you \n","and see if you were truly as great as tales say. i \n","did not believe them.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"do you now?\" said the dragon somewhat \n","flattered, even thouqh he did not believe a word \n","of it. \n","\n","\"truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the \n","reality, o smaug the chiefest and greatest of \n","calamities,\" replied bilbo. \n","\n","\"you have nice manners for a thief and a \n","liar,\" said the dragon. \"you seem familiar with \n","my name, but i don't seem to remember \n","smelling you before. who are you and where do \n","you come from, may i ask?\" \n","\n","\"you may indeed! i come from under the hill, \n","and under the hills and over the hills my paths \n","led. and through the air. i am he that walks \n","unseen.\" \n","\n","\"so i can well believe,\" said smaug, \"but \n","that is hardly your usual name.\" \n","\n","\"i am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the \n","stinging fly. i was chosen for the lucky number.\" \n","\n","\"lovely titles!\" sneered the dragon. \"but \n","lucky numbers don't always come off.\" \n","\n","\"i am he that buries his friends alive and \n","drowns them and draws them alive again from \n","the water. i came from the end of a bag, but no \n","bag went over me.\" \n","\n","\"these don't sound so creditable,\" scoffed \n","smaug. \n","\n","\"i am the friend of bears and the guest of \n","eagles. i am ringwinner and luckwearer; and i \n","\n","\n","\n","am barrel-rider,\" went on bilbo beginning to be \n","pleased with his riddling. \n","\n","\"that's better!\" said smaug. \"but don't let \n","your imagination run away with you!\" \n","\n","\n","this of course is the way to talk to dragons, if \n","you don't want to reveal your proper name \n","(which is wise), and don't want to infuriate them \n","by a flat refusal (which is also very wise). no \n","dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk \n","and of wasting time trying to understand it. \n","there was a lot here which smaug did not \n","understand at all (though i expect you do, since \n","you know all about bilbo's adventures to which \n","he was referring), but he thought he understood \n","enough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside. \n","\n","\"i thought so last night,\" he smiled to \n","himself. \"lake-men, some nasty scheme of \n","those miserable tub-trading lake-men, or i'm a \n","lizard. i haven't been down that way for an age \n","and an age; but i will soon alter that!\" \n","\n","\"very well, o barrel-rider!\" he said aloud. \n","\"maybe barrel was your pony's name; and \n","maybe not, though it was fat enough. you may \n","walk unseen, but you did not walk all the way. \n","let me tell you i ate six ponies last night and i \n","shall catch and eat all the others before long. in \n","\n","\n","\n","return for the excellent meal i will give you one \n","piece of advice for your good: don't have more \n","to do with dwarves than you can help!\" \n","\n","\"dwarves!\" said bilbo in pretended \n","surprise. \n","\n","\"don't talk to me!\" said smaug. \"i know the \n","smell (and taste) of dwarf - no one better. don't \n","tell me that i can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and \n","not know it! you'll come to a bad end, if you go \n","with such friends, thief barrel-rider. i don't mind \n","if you go back and tell them so from me.\" but he \n","did not tell bilbo that there was one smell he \n","could not make out at all, hobbit-smell; it was \n","quite outside his experience and puzzled him \n","mightily. \n","\n","\"i suppose you got a fair price for that cup \n","last night?\" he went on. \"come now, did you? \n","nothing at all! well, that's just like them. and i \n","suppose they are skulking outside, and your job \n","is to do all the dangerous work and get what \n","you can when i'm not looking - for them? and \n","you will get a fair share? don't you believe it! if \n","you get off alive, you will be lucky.\" \n","\n","\n","bilbo was now beginning to feel really \n","uncomfortable. whenever smaug's roving eye, \n","seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across \n","\n","\n","\n","him, he trembled, and an unaccountable desire \n","seized hold of him to rush out and reveal \n","himself and tell all the truth to smaug. in fact he \n","was in grievous danger of coming under the \n","dragon-spell. but plucking up courage he spoke \n","again. \n","\n","\"you don't know everything, o smaug the \n","mighty,\" said he. \"not gold alone brought us \n","hither.\" \n","\n","\"ha! ha! you admit the 'us'\" laughed \n","smaug. \"why not say 'us fourteen' and be done \n","with it, mr. lucky number? i am pleased to hear \n","that you had other business in these parts \n","besides my gold. in that case you may, \n","perhaps, not altogether waste your time. \n","\n","\"i don't know if it has occurred to you that, \n","even if you could steal the gold bit by bit - a \n","matter of a hundred years or so - you could not \n","get it very far? not much use on the mountain- \n","side? not much use in the forest? bless me! \n","had you never thought of the catch? a \n","fourteenth share, i suppose, or something like it, \n","those were the terms, eh? but what about \n","delivery? what about cartage? what about \n","armed guards and tolls?\" and smaug laughed \n","aloud. he had a wicked and a wily heart, and he \n","knew his guesses were not far out, though he \n","suspected that the lake-men were at the back \n","of the plans, and that most of the plunder was \n","\n","\n","\n","meant to stop there in the town by the shore that \n","in his young days had been called esgaroth. \n","\n","you will hardly believe it, but poor bilbo was \n","really very taken aback. so far all his thoughts \n","and energies had been concentrated on getting \n","to the mountain and finding the entrance. he \n","had never bothered to wonder how the treasure \n","was to be removed, certainly never how any \n","part of it that might fall to his share was to be \n","brought back all the way to bag-end under-hill. \n","\n","now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his \n","mind - had the dwarves forgotten this important \n","point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves \n","at him all the time? that is the effect that \n","dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. bilbo of \n","course ought to have been on his guard; but \n","smaug had rather an overwhelming personality. \n","\n","\"i tell you,\" he said, in an effort to remain \n","loyal to his friends and to keep his end up, \"that \n","gold was only an afterthought with us. we came \n","over hill and under hill, by wave and wind, for \n","revenge. surely, o smaug the unassessably \n","wealthy, you must realize that your success has \n","made you some bitter enemies?\" \n","\n","then smaug really did laugh - a \n","devastating sound which shook bilbo to the \n","floor, while far up in the tunnel the dwarves \n","huddled together and imagined that the hobbit \n","had come to a sudden and a nasty end. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"revenge!\" he snorted, and the light of his \n","eyes lit the hall from floor to ceiling like scarlet \n","lightning. ''revenge! the king under the \n","mountain is dead and where are his kin that \n","dare seek revenge? girion lord of dale is \n","dead, and i have eaten his people like a wolf \n","among sheep, and where are his sons' sons \n","that dare approach me? i kill where i wish and \n","none dare resist. i laid low the warriors of old \n","and their like is not in the world today. then i \n","was but young and tender. now i am old and \n","strong, strong, strong, thief in the shadows!\" he \n","gloated. \"my armour is like tenfold shields, my \n","teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock \n","of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, \n","and my breath death!\" \n","\n","\"i have always understood,\" said bilbo in a \n","frightened squeak, \"that dragons were softer \n","underneath, especially in the region of the - er \n","- chest; but doubtless one so fortified has \n","thought of that.\" \n","\n","the dragon stopped short in his boasting. \n","\"your information is antiquated,\" he snapped. \"i \n","am armoured above and below with iron scales \n","and hard gems. no blade can pierce me.\" \n","\n","\"i might have guessed it,\" said bilbo. \"truly \n","there can nowhere be found the equal of lord \n","smaug the impenetrable. what magnificence to \n","possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed,\" said \n","smaug absurdly pleased. he did not know that \n","the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his \n","peculiar under-covering on his previous visit, \n","and was itching for a closer view for reasons of \n","his own. the dragon rolled over. \"look!\" he \n","said. \"what do you say to that?\" \n","\n","\"dazzlingly marvellous! perfect! flawless! \n","staggering!\" exclaimed bilbo aloud, but what \n","he thought inside was: \"old fool! why, there is a \n","large patch in the hollow of his left breast as \n","bare as a snail out of its shell!\" \n","\n","after he had seen that mr. baggins' one \n","idea was to get away. \"well, i really must not \n","detain your magnificence any longer,\" he said, \n","\"or keep you from much needed rest. ponies \n","take some catching, i believe, after a long start. \n","and so do burglars,\" he added as a parting \n","shot, as he darted back and fled up the tunnel. \n","\n","it was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon \n","spouted terrific flames after him, and fast \n","though he sped up the slope, he had not gone \n","nearly far enough to be comfortable before the \n","ghastly head of smaug was thrust against the \n","opening behind. luckily the whole head and \n","jaws could not squeeze in, but the nostrils sent \n","forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he was \n","nearly overcome, and stumbled blindly on in \n","great pain and fear. he had been feeling rather \n","\n","\n","\n","pleased with the cleverness of his conversation \n","with smaug, but his mistake at the end shook \n","him into better sense. \n","\n","\"never laugh at live dragons, bilbo you \n","fool!\" he said to himself, and it became a \n","favourite saying of his later, and passed into a \n","proverb. ''you aren't nearly through this \n","adventure yet,\" he added, and that was pretty \n","true as well. \n","\n","\n","the afternoon was turning into evening when he \n","came out again and stumbled and fell in a faint \n","on the 'doorstep'. the dwarves revived him, \n","and doctored his scorches as well as they \n","could; but it was a long time before the hair on \n","the back of his head and his heels grew \n","properly again: it had all been singed and \n","frizzled right down to the skin. in the meanwhile \n","his friends did their best to cheer him up; and \n","they were eager for his story, especially wanting \n","to know why the dragon had made such an \n","awful noise, and how bilbo had escaped. \n","\n","but the hobbit was worried and \n","uncomfortable, and they had difficulty in getting \n","anything out of him. on thinking things over he \n","was now regretting some of the things he had \n","said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat \n","\n","\n","\n","them. the old thrush was sitting on a rock near \n","by with his head cocked on one side, listening \n","to all that was said. it shows what an ill temper \n","bilbo was in: he picked up a stone and threw it \n","at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and \n","came back. \n","\n","\"drat the bird!\" said bilbo crossly. \"i believe \n","he is listening, and i don't like the look of him.\" \n","\n","\"leave him alone!\" said thorin. \"the \n","thrushes are good and friendly - this is a very \n","old bird indeed, and is maybe the last left of the \n","ancient breed that used to live about here, tame \n","to the hands of my father and grandfather. they \n","were a long-lived and magical race, and this \n","might even be one of those that were alive then, \n","a couple of hundreds of years or more ago. the \n","men of dale used to have the trick of \n","understanding their language, and used them \n","for messengers to fly to the men of the lake \n","and elsewhere.\" \n","\n","\"well, he'll have news to take to lake-town \n","all right, if that is what he is after,\" said bilbo; \n","\"though i don't suppose there are any people \n","left there that trouble with thrush-language.\" \n","\n","\"why what has happened?\" cried the \n","dwarves. \"do get on with your tale!\" \n","\n","so bilbo told them all he could remember, \n","and he confessed that he had a nasty feeling \n","that the dragon guessed too much from his \n","\n","\n","\n","riddles added to the camps and the ponies. \"i \n","am sure he knows we came from lake-town \n","and had help from there; and i have a horrible \n","feeling that his next move may be in that \n","direction. i wish to goodness i had never said \n","that about barrel-rider; it would make even a \n","blind rabbit in these parts think of the lake- \n","men.\" \n","\n","\"well, well! it cannot be helped, and it is \n","difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon, or so i \n","have always heard,\" said balin anxious to \n","comfort him. \"i think you did very well, if you ask \n","me - you found out one very useful thing at any \n","rate, and got home alive, and that is more than \n","most can say who have had words with the likes \n","of smaug. it may be a mercy and a blessing yet \n","to know of the bare patch in the old worm's \n","diamond waistcoat.\" \n","\n","that turned the conversation, and they all \n","began discussing dragon-slayings historical, \n","dubious, and mythical, and the various sorts of \n","stabs and jabs and undercuts, and the different \n","arts devices and stratagems by which they had \n","been accomplished. the general opinion was \n","that catching a dragon napping was not as easy \n","as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or \n","prod one asleep was more likely to end in \n","disaster than a bold frontal attack. all the while \n","they talked the thrush listened, till at last when \n","\n","\n","\n","the stars began to peep forth, it silently spread \n","its wings and flew away. and all the while they \n","talked and the shadows lengthened bilbo \n","became more and more unhappy and his \n","foreboding grew. \n","\n","at last he interrupted them. \"i am sure we \n","are very unsafe here,\" he said, \"and i don't see \n","the point of sitting here. the dragon has \n","withered all the pleasant green, and anyway the \n","night has come and it is cold. but i feel it in my \n","bones that this place will be attacked again. \n","smaug knows now how i came down to his hall, \n","and you can trust him to guess where the other \n","end of the tunnel is. he will break all this side of \n","the mountain to bits, if necessary, to stop up our \n","entrance, and if we are smashed with it the \n","better he will like it.\" \n","\n","\"you are very gloomy, mr. baggins!\" said \n","thorin. \"why has not smaug blocked the lower \n","end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? he \n","has not, or we should have heard him.\" \n","\n","\"i don't know, i don't know - because at first \n","he wanted to try and lure me in again, i \n","suppose, and now perhaps because he is \n","waiting till after tonight's hunt, or because he \n","does not want to damage his bedroom if he can \n","help it - but i wish you would not argue. smaug \n","will be coming out at any minute now, and our \n","only hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the \n","\n","\n","\n","door.\" \n","\n","he seemed so much in earnest that the \n","dwarves at last did as he said, though they \n","delayed shutting the door - it seemed a \n","desperate plan, for no one knew whether or \n","how they could get it open again from the \n","inside, and the thought of being shut in a place \n","from which the only way out led through the \n","dragon's lair was not one they liked. also \n","everything seemed quite quiet, both outside \n","and down the tunnel. so for a longish while they \n","sat inside not far down from the half-open door \n","and went on talking. \n","\n","the talk turned to the dragon's wicked \n","words about the dwarves. bilbo wished he had \n","never heard them, or at least that he could feel \n","quite certain that the dwarves now were \n","absolutely honest when they declared that they \n","had never thought at all about what would \n","happen after the treasure had been won. \"we \n","knew it would be a desperate venture,\" said \n","thorin, \"and we know that still; and i still think \n","that when we have won it will be time enough to \n","think what to do about it. as for your share, mr. \n","baggins, i assure you we are more than grateful \n","and you shall choose your own fourteenth, as \n","soon as we have anything to divide. i am sorry if \n","you are worried about transport, and i admit the \n","difficulties are great - the lands have not \n","\n","\n","\n","become less wild with the passing of time, \n","rather the reverse - but we will do whatever we \n","can for you, and take our share of the cost when \n","the time comes. believe me or not as you like!\" \n","\n","from that the talk turned to the great hoard \n","itself and to the things that thorin and balin \n","remembered. they wondered if they were still \n","lying there unharmed in the hall below: the \n","spears that were made for the armies of the \n","great king bladorthin (long since dead), each \n","had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were \n","inlaid with cunning gold, but they were never \n","delivered or paid for; shields made for warriors \n","long dead; the great golden cup of thror, two- \n","handed, hammered and carven with birds and \n","flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; \n","coats of mail gilded and silvered and \n","impenetrable; the necklace of girion, lord of \n","dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as \n","grass, which he gave for the arming of his \n","eldest son in a coat of dwarf-linked rings the \n","like of which had never been made before, for it \n","was wrought of pure silver to the power and \n","strength of triple steel. but fairest of all was the \n","great white gem, which the dwarves had found \n","beneath the roots of the mountain, the heart of \n","the mountain, the arkenstone of thrain. \n","\n","\"the arkenstone! the arkenstone!\" \n","murmured thorin in the dark, half dreaming with \n","\n","\n","\n","his chin upon his knees. \"it was like a globe with \n","a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the \n","firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under \n","the stars, like rain upon the moon!\" \n","\n","but the enchanted desire of the hoard had \n","fallen from bilbo. all through their talk he was \n","only half listening to them. he sat nearest to the \n","door with one ear cocked for any beginnings of \n","a sound without, his other was alert for echoes \n","beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any \n","whisper of a movement from far below. \n","\n","darkness grew deeper and he grew ever \n","more uneasy. \"shut the door!\" he begged them, \n","\"i fear that dragon in my marrow. i like this \n","silence far less than the uproar of last night. \n","shut the door before it is too late!\" \n","\n","something in his voice gave the dwarves \n","an uncomfortable feeling. slowly thorin shook \n","off his dreams and getting up he kicked away \n","the stone that wedged the door. then they thrust \n","upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. \n","no trace of a keyhole was there left on the \n","inside. they were shut in the mountain! \n","\n","and not a moment too soon. they had \n","hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when \n","a blow smote the side of the mountain like the \n","crash of battering-rams made of forest oaks \n","and swung by giants. the rock boomed, the \n","walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on \n","\n","\n","\n","their heads. what would have happened if the \n","door had still been open i don't like to think. \n","they fled further down the tunnel glad to be still \n","alive, while behind them outside they heard the \n","roar and rumble of smaug's fury. he was \n","breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and \n","cliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their \n","little lofty camping ground, the scorched grass, \n","the thrush's stone, the snail-covered walls, the \n","narrow ledge, and all disappeared in a jumble \n","of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered \n","stones fell over the cliff into the valley below. \n","\n","smaug had left his lair in silent stealth, \n","quietly soared into the air, and then floated \n","heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous \n","crow, down the wind towards the west of the \n","mountain, in the hopes of catching unawares \n","something or somebody there, and of spying \n","the outlet to the passage which the thief had \n","used. this was the outburst of his wrath when \n","he could find nobody and see nothing, even \n","where he guessed the outlet must actually be. \n","\n","after he had let off his rage in this way he \n","felt better and he thought in his heart that he \n","would not be troubled again from that direction. \n","in the meanwhile he had further vengeance to \n","take. \"barrel-rider!\" he snorted. \"your feet came \n","from the waterside and up the water you came \n","without a doubt. i don't know your smell, but if \n","\n","\n","\n","you are not one of those men of the lake, you \n","had their help. they shall see me and \n","remember who is the real king under the \n","mountain!\" \n","\n","he rose in fire and went away south \n","towards the running river. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter x iii \n","\n","\n","not at home \n","\n","\n","in the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, \n","and utter silence fell about them. little they ate \n","and little they spoke. they could not count the \n","passing of time; and they scarcely dared to \n","move, for the whisper of their voices echoed \n","and rustled in the tunnel. if they dozed, they \n","woke still to darkness and to silence going on \n","unbroken. at last after days and days of waiting, \n","as it seemed, when they were becoming \n","choked and dazed for want of air, they could \n","bear it no longer. they would almost have \n","welcomed sounds from below of the dragon's \n","return. in the silence they feared some cunning \n","devilry of his, but they could not sit there for \n","ever. \n","\n","thorin spoke: \"let us try the door!\" he said. \n","\"i must feel the wind on my face soon or die. i \n","think i would rather be smashed by smaug in \n","the open than suffocate in here!\" so several of \n","\n","\n","the dwarves got up and groped back to where \n","the door had been. but they found that the \n","upper end of the tunnel had been shattered and \n","blocked with broken rock. neither key nor the \n","magic it had once obeyed would ever open that \n","door again. \n","\n","\"we are trapped!\" they groaned. \"this is the \n","end. we shall die here.\" \n","\n","but somehow, just when the dwarves were \n","most despairing, bilbo felt a strange lightening \n","of the heart, as if a heavyweight had gone from \n","under his waistcoat. \n","\n","\"come, come!\" he said. '\"while there's life \n","there's hope!' as my father used to say, and \n","third time pays for all.' i am going down the \n","tunnel once again. i have been that way twice, \n","when i knew there was a dragon at the other \n","end, so i will risk a third visit when i am no \n","longer sure. anyway the only way out is down. \n","and i think this time you had better all come with \n","me.\" \n","\n","in desperation they agreed, and thorin was \n","the first to go forward by bilbo's side. \n","\n","\"now do be careful!\" whispered the hobbit, \n","\"and as quiet as you can be! there may be no \n","smaug at the bottom, but then again there may \n","be. don't let us take any unnecessary risks!\" \n","\n","down, down they went. the dwarves could \n","not, of course, compare with the hobbit in real \n","\n","\n","\n","stealth, and they made a deal of puffing and \n","shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; \n","but though every now and again bilbo in fear \n","stopped and listened, not a sound stirred \n","below. near the bottom, as well as he could \n","judge, bilbo slipped on his ring and went \n","ahead. but he did not need it: the darkness was \n","complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no \n","ring. in fact so black was it that the hobbit came \n","to the opening unexpectedly, put his hand on \n","air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong into \n","the hall! \n","\n","there he lay face downwards on the floor \n","and did not dare to get up, or hardly even to \n","breathe. but nothing moved. there was not a \n","gleam of light - unless, as it seemed to him, \n","when at last he slowly raised his head, there \n","was a pale white glint, above him and far off in \n","the gloom. but certainly it was not a spark of \n","dragon-fire, though the worm-stench was heavy \n","in the place, and the taste of vapour was on his \n","tongue. \n","\n","at length mr. baggins could bear it no \n","longer. \"confound you, smaug, you worm!\" he \n","squeaked aloud. \"stop playing hide-and-seek! \n","give me a light, and then eat me, if you can \n","catch me!\" \n","\n","faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but \n","there was no answer. \n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo got up, and found that he did not know \n","in what direction to turn. \n","\n","\"now i wonder what on earth smaug is \n","playing at,\" he said. \"he is not at home today \n","(or tonight, or whatever it is), i do believe. if oin \n","and gloin have not lost their tinder-boxes, \n","perhaps we can make a little light, and have a \n","look round before the luck turns.\" \n","\n","\"light!\" he cried. \"can anybody make a \n","light?\" \n","\n","\n","the dwarves, of course, were very alarmed \n","when bilbo fell forward down the step with a \n","bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just \n","where he had left them at the end of the tunnel. \n","\n","\"sh! sh!\" they hissed, when they heard his \n","voice; and though that helped the hobbit to find \n","out where they were, it was some time before \n","he could get anything else out of them. but in \n","the end, when bilbo actually began to stamp on \n","the floor, and screamed out \"light!\" at the top of \n","his shrill voice, thorin gave way, and oin and \n","gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top \n","of the tunnel. \n","\n","after a while a twinkling gleam showed \n","them returning, oin with a small pine-torch alight \n","in his hand, and gloin with a bundle of others \n","\n","\n","\n","under his arm. quickly bilbo trotted to the door \n","and took the torch; but he could not persuade \n","the dwarves to light the others or to come and \n","join him yet. as thorin carefully explained, mr. \n","baggins was still officially their expert burglar \n","and investigator. if he liked to risk a light, that \n","was his affair. they would wait in the tunnel for \n","his report. so they sat near the door and \n","watched. \n","\n","they saw the little dark shape of the hobbit \n","start across the floor holding his tiny light aloft. \n","every now and again, while he was still near \n","enough, they caught a glint and a tinkle as he \n","stumbled on some golden thing. the light grew \n","smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall; \n","then it began to rise dancing into the air. bilbo \n","was climbing the great mound of treasure. \n","soon he stood upon the top, and still went on. \n","then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; \n","but they did not know the reason. \n","\n","it was the arkenstone, the heart of the \n","mountain. so bilbo guessed from thorin's \n","description; but indeed there could not be two \n","such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, \n","even in all the world. ever as he climbed, the \n","same white gleam had shone before him and \n","drawn his feet towards it. slowly it grew to a \n","little globe of pallid light. now as he came near, \n","it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of many \n","\n","\n","\n","colours at the surface, reflected and splintered \n","from the wavering light of his torch. at last he \n","looked down upon it, and he caught his breath. \n","the great jewel shone before his feet of its own \n","inner light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the \n","dwarves, who had dug it from the heart of the \n","mountain long ago, it took all light that fell upon \n","it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of \n","white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow. \n","\n","suddenly bilbo's arm went towards it drawn \n","by its enchantment. his small hand would not \n","close about it, for it was a large and heavy gem; \n","but he lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in his \n","deepest pocket. \n","\n","\"now i am a burglar indeed!\" thought he. \n","\"but i suppose i must tell the dwarves about it - \n","some time. they did say i could pick and \n","choose my own share; and i think i would \n","choose this, if they took all the rest!\" all the \n","same he had an uncomfortable feeling that the \n","picking and choosing had not really been meant \n","to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble \n","would yet come of it. \n","\n","now he went on again. down the other side \n","of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of \n","his torch vanished from the sight of the watching \n","dwarves. but soon they saw it far away in the \n","distance again. bilbo was crossing the floor of \n","the hall. \n","\n","\n","\n","he went on, until he came to the great \n","doors at the further side, and there a draught of \n","air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his \n","light. he peeped timidly through, and caught a \n","glimpse of great passages and of the dim \n","beginnings of wide stairs going up into the \n","gloom. and still there was no sight nor sound of \n","smaug. he was just going to turn and go back, \n","when a black shape swooped at him, and \n","brushed his face. he squeaked and started, \n","stumbled backwards and fell. his torch dropped \n","head downwards and went out! \n","\n","\"only a bat, i suppose and hope!\" he said \n","miserably. \"but now what am i to do? which is \n","east, south, north, or west?\" \n","\n","\"thorin! balin! oin! gloin! fili! kili!\" he cried \n","as loud as he could - it seemed a thin little \n","noise in the wide blackness. \"the light's gone \n","out! someone come and find me and help me!\" \n","for the moment his courage had failed \n","altogether. \n","\n","faintly the dwarves heard his small cries, \n","though the only word they could catch was \n","\"help!\" \n","\n","\"now what on earth or under it has \n","happened?\" said thorin. \"certainly not the \n","dragon, or he would not go on squeaking.\" \n","\n","they waited a moment or two, and still there \n","were no dragon-noises, no sound at all in fact \n","\n","\n","\n","but bilbo's distant voice. \"come, one of you, \n","get another light or two!\" thorin ordered. \"it \n","seems we have got to go and help our burglar.\" \n","\n","\"it is about our turn to help,\" said balin, \"and \n","i am quite willing to go. anyway i expect it is \n","safe for the moment.\" \n","\n","gloin lit several more torches, and then they \n","all crept out, one by one, and went along the \n","wall as hurriedly as they could. it was not long \n","before they met bilbo himself coming back \n","towards them. his wits had quickly returned as \n","soon as he saw the twinkle of their lights. \n","\n","\"only a bat and a dropped torch, nothing \n","worse!\" he said in answer to their questions. \n","though they were much relieved, they were \n","inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for \n","nothing; but what they would have said, if he \n","had told them at that moment about the \n","arkenstone, i don't know. the mere fleeting \n","glimpses of treasure which they had caught as \n","they went along had rekindled all the fire of their \n","dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, \n","even the most respectable, is wakened by gold \n","and by jewels, he grows suddenly bold, and he \n","may become fierce. \n","\n","the dwarves indeed no longer needed any \n","urging. all were now eager to explore the hall \n","while they had the chance, and willing to believe \n","that, for the present, smaug was away from \n","\n","\n","\n","home. each now gripped a lighted torch; and \n","as they gazed, first on one side and then on \n","another, they forgot fear and even caution. they \n","spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as \n","they lifted old treasures from the mound or from \n","the wall and held them in the light, caressing \n","and fingering them. \n","\n","fili and kili were almost in merry mood, \n","and finding still hanging there many golden \n","harps strung with silver they took them and \n","struck them; and being magical (and also \n","untouched by the dragon, who had small \n","interest in music) they were still in tune. the \n","dark hall was filled with a melody that had long \n","been silent. but most of the dwarves were more \n","practical: they gathered gems and stuffed their \n","pockets, and let what they could not carry fall \n","back through their fingers with a sigh. thorin \n","was not least among these; but always he \n","searched from side to side for something which \n","he could not find. it was the arkenstone; but he \n","spoke of it yet to no one. \n","\n","now the dwarves took down mail and \n","weapons from the walls, and armed \n","themselves. royal indeed did thorin look, clad \n","in a coat of gold-plated rings, with a silver- \n","hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones. \n","\n","\"mr. baggins!\" he cried. \"here is the first \n","payment of your reward! cast off your old coat \n","\n","\n","\n","and put on this!\" \n","\n","with that he put on bilbo a small coat of \n","mail, wrought for some young elf-prince long \n","ago. it was of silver-steel, which the elves call \n","mithril, and with it went a belt of pearls and \n","crystals. a light helm of figured leather, \n","strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and \n","studded about the brim with white gems, was \n","set upon the hobbit's head. \n","\n","\"i feel magnificent,\" he thought; \"but i expect \n","i look rather absurd. how they would laugh on \n","the hill at home! still i wish there was a looking- \n","glass handy!\" \n","\n","all the same mr. baggins kept his head \n","more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than \n","the dwarves did. long before the dwarves were \n","tired of examining the treasures, he became \n","weary of it and sat down on the floor; and he \n","began to wonder nervously what the end of it all \n","would be. \"i would give a good many of these \n","precious goblets,\" he thought, \"for a drink of \n","something cheering out of one of beorn's \n","wooden bowls!\" \n","\n","\"thorin!\" he cried aloud. \"what next? we \n","are armed, but what good has any armour ever \n","been before against smaug the dreadful? this \n","treasure is not yet won back. we are not \n","looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape; \n","and we have tempted luck too long!\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"you speak the truth!\" answered thorin, \n","recovering his wits. \"let us go! i will guide you. \n","not in a thousand years should i forget the ways \n","of this palace.\" then he hailed the others, and \n","they gathered together, and holding their \n","torches above their heads they passed through \n","the gaping doors, not without many a backward \n","glance of longing. \n","\n","their glittering mail they had covered again \n","with their old cloaks and their bright helms with \n","their tattered hoods, and one by one they \n","walked behind thorin, a line of little lights in the \n","darkness that halted often, listening in fear once \n","more for any rumour of the dragon's coming. \n","\n","though all the old adornments were long \n","mouldered or destroyed, and though all was \n","befouled and blasted with the comings and \n","goings of the monster, thorin knew every \n","passage and every turn. they climbed long \n","stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing \n","ways, and turned again and climbed yet more \n","stairs, and yet more stairs again. these were \n","smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and fair; \n","and up, up, the dwarves went, and they met no \n","sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that \n","fled from the approach of their torches fluttering \n","in the draughts. \n","\n","the steps were not made, all the same, for \n","hobbit-legs, and bilbo was just feeling that he \n","\n","\n","\n","could go on no longer, when suddenly the roof \n","sprang high and far beyond the reach of their \n","torch-light. a white glimmer could be seen \n","coming through some opening far above, and \n","the air smelt sweeter. before them light came \n","dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on \n","their hinges and half burnt. \n","\n","\"this is the great chamber of thror,\" said \n","thorin; \"the hall of feasting and of council. not \n","far off now is the front gate.\" \n","\n","they passed through the ruined chamber. \n","tables were rotting there; chairs and benches \n","were lying there overturned, charred and \n","decaying. skulls and bones were upon the floor \n","among flagons and bowls and broken drinking- \n","horns and dust. as they came through yet more \n","doors at the further end, a sound of water fell \n","upon their ears, and the grey light grew \n","suddenly more full. \n","\n","\"there is the birth of the running river,\" \n","said thorin. \"from here it hastens to the gate. \n","let us follow it!\" \n","\n","out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there \n","issued a boiling water, and it flowed swirling in \n","a narrow channel, carved and made straight \n","and deep by the cunning of ancient hands. \n","beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough \n","for many men abreast. swiftly along this they \n","ran, and round a wide-sweeping turn - and \n","\n","\n","\n","behold! before them stood the broad light of \n","day. in front there rose a tall arch, still showing \n","the fragments of old carven work within, worn \n","and splintered and blackened though it was. a \n","misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of \n","the mountain, and beams of gold fell on the \n","pavement at the threshold. \n","\n","a whirl of bats frightened from slumber by \n","their smoking torches flurried over them; as they \n","sprang forward their feet slithered on stones \n","rubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of \n","the dragon. now before them the water fell \n","noisily outward and foamed down towards the \n","valley. they flung their pale torches to the \n","ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled \n","eyes. they were come to the front gate, and \n","were looking out upon dale. \n","\n","\"well!\" said bilbo, \"i never expected to be \n","looking out of this door. and i never expected to \n","be so pleased to see the sun again, and to feel \n","the wind on my face. but, ow! this wind is cold!\" \n","\n","it was. a bitter easterly breeze blew with a \n","threat of oncoming winter. it swirled over and \n","round the arms of the mountain into the valley, \n","and sighed among the rocks. after their long \n","time in the stewing depths of the dragon- \n","haunted caverns, they shivered in the sun. \n","\n","suddenly bilbo realized that he was not only \n","tired but also very hungry indeed. \"it seems to \n","\n","\n","\n","be late morning,\" he said, ''and so i suppose it \n","is more or less breakfast-time - if there is any \n","breakfast to have. but i don't feel that smaug's \n","front doorstep is the safest place for a meal. do \n","let's go somewhere where we can sit quiet for a \n","bit!\" \n","\n","\"quite right!\" said balin. \"and i think i know \n","which way we should go: we ought to make for \n","the old look-out post at the south-west corner \n","of the mountain.\" \n","\n","\"how far is that?\" asked the hobbit. \n","\n","\"five hours march, i should think. it will be \n","rough going. the road from the gate along the \n","left edge of the stream seems all broken up. but \n","look down there! the river loops suddenly east \n","across dale in front of the ruined town. at that \n","point there was once a bridge, leading to steep \n","stairs that climbed up the right bank, and so to \n","a road running towards ravenhill. there is (or \n","was) a path that left the road and climbed up to \n","the post. a hard climb, too, even if the old steps \n","are still there.\" \n","\n","\"dear me!\" grumbled the hobbit. \"more \n","walking and more climbing without breakfast! i \n","wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals, \n","we have missed inside that nasty clockless, \n","timeless hole?\" \n","\n","as a matter of fact two nights and the day \n","between had gone by (and not altogether \n","\n","\n","\n","without food) since the dragon smashed the \n","magic door, but bilbo had quite lost count, and \n","it might have been one night or a week of nights \n","for all he could tell. \n","\n","\"come, come!\" said thorin laughing - his \n","spirits had begun to rise again, and he rattled \n","the precious stones in his pockets. \"don't call \n","my palace a nasty hole! you wait till it has been \n","cleaned and redecorated!\" \n","\n","\"that won't be till smaug's dead,\" said \n","bilbo glumly. \"in the meanwhile where is he? i \n","would give a good breakfast to know. i hope he \n","is not up on the mountain looking down at us!\" \n","\n","that idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, \n","and they quickly decided that bilbo and balin \n","were right. \n","\n","\"we must move away from here,\" said dori. \n","\"i feel as if his eyes were on the back of my \n","head.\" \n","\n","\"it's a cold lonesome place,\" said bombur. \n","\"there may be drink, but i see no sign of food. \n","a dragon would always be hungry in such \n","parts.\" \n","\n","\"come on! come on!\" cried the others. \"let \n","us follow balin's path!\" \n","\n","\n","under the rocky wall to the right there was no \n","\n","\n","\n","path, so on they trudged among the stones on \n","the left side of the river, and the emptiness and \n","desolation soon sobered even thorin again. \n","the bridge that balin had spoken of they found \n","long fallen, and most of its stones were now \n","only boulders in the shallow noisy stream; but \n","they forded the water without much difficulty, \n","and found the ancient steps, and climbed the \n","high bank. after going a short way they struck \n","the old road, and before long came to a deep \n","dell sheltered among the rocks; there they \n","rested for a while and had such a breakfast as \n","they could, chiefly cram and water. (if you want \n","to know what cram is, i can only say that i don't \n","know the recipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good \n","indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and \n","is certainly not entertaining, being in fact very \n","uninteresting except as a chewing exercise. it \n","was made by the lake-men for long journeys.) \n","\n","after that they went on again; and now the \n","road struck westwards and left the river, and the \n","great shoulder of the south-pointing mountain- \n","spur drew ever nearer. at length they reached \n","the hill path. it scrambled steeply up, and they \n","plodded slowly one behind the other, till at last \n","in the late afternoon they came to the top of the \n","ridqe and saw the wintry sun qoinq downwards \n","to the west. \n","\n","here they found a flat place without a wall \n","\n","\n","\n","on three sides, but backed to the north by a \n","rocky face in which there was an opening like a \n","door. from that door there was a wide view \n","east and south and west. \n","\n","\"here,\" said balin, \"in the old days we used \n","always to keep watchmen, and that door behind \n","leads into a rockhewn chamber that was made \n","here as a guardroom. there were several \n","places like it round the mountain. but there \n","seemed small need for watching in the days of \n","our prosperity, and the guards were made over \n","comfortable, perhaps - otherwise we might \n","have had longer warning of the coming of the \n","dragon, and things might have been different. \n","still, here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a \n","while, and can see much without being seen.\" \n","\n","\"not much use, if we have been seen \n","coming here,\" said dori, who was always \n","looking up towards the mountain's peak, as if \n","he expected to see smaug perched there like a \n","bird on a steeple. \n","\n","\"we must take our chance of that,\" said \n","thorin. \"we can go no further to-day.\" \n","\n","\"hear, hear!\" cried bilbo, and flung himself \n","on the ground. \n","\n","in the rock-chamber there would have been \n","room for a hundred, and there was a small \n","chamber further in, more removed from the cold \n","outside. it was quite deserted; not even wild \n","\n","\n","\n","animals seemed to have used it in all the days \n","of smaug's dominion. there they laid their \n","burdens; and some threw themselves down at \n","once and slept, but the others sat near the outer \n","door and discussed their plans. in all their talk \n","they came perpetually back to one thing: where \n","was smaug? they looked west and there was \n","nothing, and east there was nothing, and in the \n","south there was no sign of the dragon, but there \n","was a gathering of very many birds. at that they \n","gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer \n","understanding it, when the first cold stars came \n","out. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter xiv \n","\n","\n","fire and water \n","\n","\n","now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news \n","of smaug, you must go back again to the \n","evening when he smashed the door and flew off \n","in rage, two days before. \n","\n","the men of the lake-town esgaroth were \n","mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the \n","black east and chill, but a few were walking on \n","the quays, and watching, as they were fond of \n","doing, the stars shine out from the smooth \n","patches of the lake as they opened in the sky. \n","from their town the lonely mountain was mostly \n","screened by the low hills at the far end of the \n","lake, through a gap in which the running river \n","came down from the north. only its high peak \n","could they see in clear weather, and they \n","looked seldom at it, for it was ominous and \n","drear even in the light of morning. now it was \n","lost and gone, blotted in the dark. \n","\n","suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief \n","\n","\n","glow touched it and faded. \n","\n","\"look!\" said one. \"the lights again! last \n","night the watchmen saw them start and fade \n","from midnight until dawn. something is \n","happening up there.\" \n","\n","\"perhaps the king under the mountain is \n","forging gold,\" said another. \"it is long since he \n","went north. it is time the songs began to prove \n","themselves again.\" \n","\n","\"which king?\" said another with a grim \n","voice. \"as like as not it is the marauding fire of \n","the dragon, the only king under the mountain \n","we have ever known.\" \n","\n","\"you are always foreboding gloomy things!\" \n","said the others. \"anything from floods to \n","poisoned fish. think of something cheerful!\" \n","\n","then suddenly a great light appeared in the \n","low place in the hills and the northern end of the \n","lake turned golden. \"the king beneath the \n","mountain!\" they shouted. \"his wealth is like the \n","sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden \n","run! the river is running gold from the \n","mountain!\" they cried, and everywhere windows \n","were opening and feet were hurrying. \n","\n","there was once more a tremendous \n","excitement and enthusiasm. but the grim- \n","voiced fellow ran hotfoot to the master. \"the \n","dragon is coming or i am a fool!\" he cried. \"cut \n","the bridges! to arms! to arms!\" \n","\n","\n","\n","then warning trumpets were suddenly \n","sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores. \n","the cheering stopped and the joy was turned to \n","dread. so it was that the dragon did not find \n","them quite unprepared. \n","\n","before long, so great was his speed, they \n","could see him as a spark of fire rushing \n","towards them and growing ever huger and \n","more bright, and not the most foolish doubted \n","that the prophecies had gone rather wrong. still \n","they had a little time. every vessel in the town \n","was filled with water, every warrior was armed, \n","every arrow and dart was ready, and the bridge \n","to the land was thrown down and destroyed, \n","before the roar of smaug's terrible approach \n","grew loud, and the lake rippled red as fire \n","beneath the awful beating of his wings. \n","\n","amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of \n","men he came over them, swept towards the \n","bridges and was foiled! the bridge was gone, \n","and his enemies were on an island in deep \n","water - too deep and dark and cool for his \n","liking. if he plunged into it, a vapour and a \n","steam would arise enough to cover all the land \n","with a mist for days; but the lake was mightier \n","than he, it would quench him before he could \n","pass through. \n","\n","roaring he swept back over the town. a hail \n","of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and \n","\n","\n","\n","rattled on his scales and jewels, and their shafts \n","fell back kindled by his breath burning and \n","hissing into the lake. no fireworks you ever \n","imagined equalled the sights that night. at the \n","twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the \n","trumpets the dragon's wrath blazed to its height, \n","till he was blind and mad with it. no one had \n","dared to give battle to him for many an age; nor \n","would they have dared now, if it had not been \n","for the grim-voiced man (bard was his name), \n","who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and \n","urging the master to order them to fight to the \n","last arrow. \n","\n","fire leaped from the dragon's jaws. he \n","circled for a while high in the air above them \n","lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores \n","shone like copper and like blood with leaping \n","shadows of dense black at their feet. then \n","down he swooped straight through the arrow- \n","storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to \n","turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking \n","only to set their town ablaze. \n","\n","fire leaped from thatched roofs and \n","wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and \n","past and round again, though all had been \n","drenched with water before he came. once \n","more water was flung by a hundred hands \n","wherever a spark appeared. back swirled the \n","dragon. a sweep of his tail and the roof of the \n","\n","\n","\n","great house crumbled and smashed down. \n","flames unquenchable sprang high into the \n","night. another swoop and another, and another \n","house and then another sprang afire and fell; \n","and still no arrow hindered smaug or hurt him \n","more than a fly from the marshes. \n","\n","\n","already men were jumping into the water on \n","every side. women and children were being \n","huddled into laden boats in the market-pool. \n","weapons were flung down. there was \n","mourning and weeping, where but a little time \n","ago the old songs of mirth to come had been \n","sung about the dwarves. now men cursed their \n","names. the master himself was turning to his \n","great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the \n","confusion and save himself. soon all the town \n","would be deserted and burned down to the \n","surface of the lake. \n","\n","that was the dragon's hope. they could all \n","get into boats for all he cared. there he could \n","have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop \n","till they starved. let them try to get to land and \n","he would be ready. soon he would set all the \n","shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field \n","and pasture. just now he was enjoying the sport \n","of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed \n","\n","\n","\n","anything for years. \n","\n","but there was still a company of archers \n","that held their ground among the burning \n","houses. their captain was bard, grim-voiced \n","and grim-faced, whose friends had accused \n","him of prophesying floods and poisoned fish, \n","though they knew his worth and courage. he \n","was a descendant in long line of girion, lord of \n","dale, whose wife and child had escaped down \n","the running river from the ruin long ago. now \n","he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows \n","but one were spent. the flames were near him. \n","his companions were leaving him. he bent his \n","bow for the last time. \n","\n","s ud d e nly o ut of the d a rk so methi ng fl utte red \n","to his shoulder. he started - but it was only an \n","old thrush. unafraid it perched by his ear and it \n","brought him news. marvelling he found he could \n","understand its tongue, for he was of the race of \n","dale. \n","\n","\"wait! wait!\" it said to him. \"the moon is \n","rising. look for the hollow of the left breast as \n","he flies and turns above you!\" and while bard \n","paused in wonder it told him of tidings up in the \n","mountain and of all that it had heard. \n","\n","then bard drew his bow-string to his ear. \n","the dragon was circling back, flying low, and as \n","he came the moon rose above the eastern \n","shore and silvered his great wings. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"arrow!\" said the bowman. \"black arrow! i \n","have saved you to the last. you have never \n","failed me and always i have recovered you. i \n","had you from my father and he from of old. if \n","ever you came from the forges of the true king \n","under the mountain, go nowand speed well!\" \n","\n","the dragon swooped once more lower than \n","ever, and as he turned and dived down his belly \n","glittered white with sparkling fires of gems in \n","the moon - but not in one place. the great bow \n","twanged. the black arrow sped straight from \n","the string, straight for the hollow by the left \n","breast where the foreleg was flung wide. in it \n","smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so \n","fierce was its flight. with a shriek that deafened \n","men, felled trees and split stone, smaug shot \n","spouting into the air, turned over and crashed \n","down from on high in ruin. \n","\n","full on the town he fell. his last throes \n","splintered it to sparks and gledes. the lake \n","roared in. a vast steam leaped up, white in the \n","sudden dark under the moon. there was a hiss, \n","a gushing whirl, and then silence. and that was \n","the end of smaug and esgaroth, but not of \n","bard. \n","\n","\n","the waxing moon rose higher and higher and \n","\n","\n","\n","the wind grew loud and cold. it twisted the white \n","fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and \n","drove it off to the west to scatter in tattered \n","shreds over the marshes before mirkwood. \n","then the many boats could be seen dotted dark \n","on the surface of the lake, and down the wind \n","came the voices of the people of esgaroth \n","lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined \n","houses. but they had really much to be thankful \n","for, had they thought of it, though it could hardly \n","be expected that they should just then: three \n","quarters of the people of the town had at least \n","escaped alive; their woods and fields and \n","pastures and cattle and most of their boats \n","remained undamaged; and the dragon was \n","dead. what that meant they had not yet \n","realized. \n","\n","they gathered in mournful crowds upon the \n","western shores, shivering in the cold wind, and \n","their first complaints and anger were against \n","the master, who had left the town so soon, while \n","some were still willing to defend it. \n","\n","\"he may have a good head for business - \n","especially his own business,\" some murmured, \n","\"but he is no good when anything serious \n","happens!\" and they praised the courage of \n","bard and his last mighty shot. \"if only he had not \n","been killed,\" they all said, \"we would make him \n","a king. bard the dragon-shooter of the line of \n","\n","\n","\n","girion! alas that he is lost!\" \n","\n","and in the very midst of theirtalk a tall figure \n","stepped from the shadows. he was drenched \n","with water, his black hair hung wet over his face \n","and shoulders, and a fierce light was in his \n","eyes. \n","\n","\"bard is not lost!\" he cried. \"he dived from \n","esgaroth, when the enemy was slain. i am \n","bard, of the line of girion; i am the slayer of the \n","dragon!\" \n","\n","\"king bard! king bard!\" they shouted; but \n","the master ground his chattering teeth. \n","\n","\"girion was lord of dale, not king of \n","esgaroth,\" he said. \"in the lake-town we have \n","always elected masters from among the old \n","and wise, and have not endured the rule of \n","mere fighting men. let 'king bard' go back to \n","his own kingdom - dale is now freed by his \n","valour, and nothing hinders his return. and any \n","that wish can go with him, if they prefer the cold \n","stones under the shadow of the mountain to the \n","green shores of the lake. the wise will stay here \n","and hope to rebuild our town, and enjoy again in \n","time its peace and riches.\" \n","\n","\"we will have king bard!\" the people near \n","at hand shouted in reply. \"we have had enough \n","of the old men and the money-counters!\" and \n","people further off took up the cry: \"up the \n","bowman, and down with moneybags,\" till the \n","\n","\n","\n","clamour echoed along the shore. \n","\n","\"i am the last man to undervalue bard the \n","bowman,\" said the master warily (for bard now \n","stood close beside him). \"he has tonight \n","earned an eminent place in the roll of the \n","benefactors of our town; and he is worthy of \n","many imperishable songs. but, why o \n","people?\" - and here the master rose to his feet \n","and spoke very loud and clear - \"why do i get \n","all your blame? for what fault am i to be \n","deposed? who aroused the dragon from his \n","slumber, i might ask? who obtained of us rich \n","gifts and ample help, and led us to believe that \n","old songs could come true? who played on our \n","soft hearts and our pleasant fancies? what sort \n","of gold have they sent down the river to reward \n","us? dragon-fire and ruin! from whom should \n","we claim the recompense of our damage, and \n","aid for our widows and orphans?\" \n","\n","as you see, the master had not got his \n","position for nothing. the result of his words was \n","that for the moment the people quite forgot their \n","idea of a new king, and turned their angry \n","thoughts towards thorin and his company. wild \n","and bitter words were shouted from many \n","sides; and some of those who had before sung \n","the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly \n","crying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon \n","up against them deliberately! \n","\n","\n","\n","\"fools!\" said bard. \"why waste words and \n","wrath on those unhappy creatures? doubtless \n","they perished first in fire, before smaug came \n","to us.\" then even as he was speaking, the \n","thought came into his heart of the fabled \n","treasure of the mountain lying without guard or \n","owner, and he fell suddenly silent. he thought of \n","the master's words, and of dale rebuilt, and \n","filled with golden bells, if he could but find the \n","men. \n","\n","at length he spoke again: \"this is no time \n","for angry words, master, or for considering \n","weighty plans of change. there is work to do. i \n","serve you still - though after a while i may think \n","again of your words and go north with any that \n","will follow me.\" \n","\n","then he strode off to help in the ordering of \n","the camps and in the care of the sick and the \n","wounded. but the master scowled at his back \n","as he went, and remained sitting on the ground. \n","he thought much but said little, unless it was to \n","call loudly for men to bring him fire and food. \n","\n","now everywhere bard went he found talk \n","running like fire among the people concerning \n","the vast treasure that was now unguarded. men \n","spoke of the recompense for all their harm that \n","they would soon get from it, and wealth over \n","and to spare with which to buy rich things from \n","the south; and it cheered them greatly in their \n","\n","\n","\n","plight. that was as well, for the night was bitter \n","and miserable. shelters could be contrived for \n","few (the master had one) and there was little \n","food (even the master went short). many took ill \n","of wet and cold and sorrow that night, and \n","afterwards died, who had escaped uninjured \n","from the ruin of the town; and in the days that \n","followed there was much sickness and great \n","hunger. \n","\n","meanwhile bard took the lead, and ordered \n","things as he wished, though always in the \n","master's name, and he had a hard task to \n","govern the people and direct the preparations \n","for their protection and housing. probably most \n","of them would have perished in the winter that \n","now hurried after autumn, if help had not been \n","to hand. but help came swiftly; for bard at once \n","had speedy messengers sent up the river to the \n","forest to ask the aid of the king of the elves of \n","the wood, and these messengers had found a \n","host already on the move, although it was then \n","only the third day after the fall of smaug. \n","\n","the elvenking had received news from his \n","own messengers and from the birds that loved \n","his folk, and already knew much of what had \n","happened. very great indeed was the \n","commotion among all things with wings that \n","dwelt on the borders of the desolation of the \n","dragon. the air was filled with circling flocks, \n","\n","\n","\n","and their swift-flying messengers flew here and \n","there across the sky. above the borders of the \n","forest there was whistling, crying and piping. \n","far over mirkwood tidings spread: \"smaug is \n","dead!\" leaves rustled and startled ears were \n","lifted. even before the elvenking rode forth the \n","news had passed west right to the pinewoods \n","of the misty mountains; beorn had heard it in \n","his wooden house, and the goblins were at \n","council in their caves. \n","\n","\"that will be the last we shall hear of thorin \n","oakenshield, i fear,\" said the king. \"he would \n","have done better to have remained my guest. it \n","is an ill wind, all the same,\" he added, \"that \n","blows no one any good.\" for he too had not \n","forgotten the legend of the wealth of thror. so it \n","was that bard's messengers found him now \n","marching with many spearmen and bowmen; \n","and crows were gathered thick above him, for \n","they thought that war was awakening again, \n","such as had not been in those parts for a long \n","age. \n","\n","but the king, when he received the prayers \n","of bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good \n","and kindly people; so turning his march, which \n","had at first been direct towards the mountain, \n","he hastened now down the river to the long \n","lake. he had not boats or rafts enough for his \n","host, and they were forced to go the slower way \n","\n","\n","\n","by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead \n","by water. still elves are light-footed, and though \n","they were not in these days much used to the \n","marches and the treacherous lands between \n","the forest and the lake, their going was swift. \n","only five days after the death of the dragon they \n","came upon the shores and looked on the ruins \n","of the town. their welcome was good, as may \n","be expected, and the men and their master \n","were ready to make any bargain for the future in \n","return for the elvenking's aid. \n","\n","their plans were soon made. with the \n","women and the children, the old and the unfit, \n","the master remained behind; and with him were \n","some men of crafts and many skilled elves; and \n","they busied themselves felling trees, and \n","collecting the timber sent down from the forest. \n","then they set about raising many huts by the \n","shore against the oncoming winter; and also \n","under the master's direction they began the \n","planning of a new town, designed more fair and \n","large even than before, but not in the same \n","place. they removed northward higher up the \n","shore; for ever after they had a dread of the \n","water where the dragon lay. he would never \n","again return to his golden bed, but was \n","stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor \n","of the shallows. there for ages his huge bones \n","could be seen in calm weather amid the ruined \n","\n","\n","\n","piles of the old town. but few dared to cross the \n","cursed spot, and none dared to dive into the \n","shivering water or recover the precious stones \n","that fell from his rotting carcase. \n","\n","but all the men of arms who were still able, \n","and the most of the elvenking's array, got ready \n","to march north to the mountain. it was thus that \n","in eleven days from the ruin of the town the \n","head of their host passed the rock-gates at the \n","end of the lake and came into the desolate \n","lands. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter xv \n","\n","\n","the gathering of the \n","\n","clouds \n","\n","\n","now we will return to bilbo and the dwarves. all \n","night one of them had watched, but when \n","morning came they had not heard or seen any \n","sign of danger. but ever more thickly the birds \n","were gathering. their companies came flying \n","from the south; and the crows that still lived \n","about the mountain were wheeling and crying \n","unceasingly above. \n","\n","\"something strange is happening,\" said \n","thorin. \"the time has gone for the autumn \n","wanderings; and these are birds that dwell \n","always in the land; there are starlings and flocks \n","of finches; and far off there are many carrion \n","birds as if a battle were afoot!\" \n","\n","suddenly bilbo pointed: \"there is that old \n","thrush again!\" he cried. \"he seems to have \n","escaped, when smaug smashed the mountain- \n","side, but i don't suppose the snails have!\" \n","\n","\n","sure enough the old thrush was there, and \n","as bilbo pointed, he flew towards them and \n","perched on a stone near by. then he fluttered \n","his wings and sang; then he cocked his head \n","on one side, as if to listen; and again he sang, \n","and again he listened. \n","\n","\"i believe he is trying to tell us something,\" \n","said balin; ''but i cannot follow the speech of \n","such birds, it is very quick and difficult. can you \n","make it out baggins?\" \n","\n","\"not very well,\" said bilbo (as a matter of \n","fact, he could make nothing of it at all); \"but the \n","old fellow seems very excited.\" \n","\n","\"i only wish he was a raven!\" said balin. \n","\n","\"i thought you did not like them! you \n","seemed very shy of them, when we came this \n","way before.\" \n","\n","\"those were crows! and nasty suspicious- \n","looking creatures at that, and rude as well. you \n","must have heard the ugly names they were \n","calling after us. but the ravens are different. \n","there used to be great friendship between \n","them and the people of thror; and they often \n","brought us secret news, and were rewarded \n","with such bright things as they coveted to hide \n","in their dwellings. \n","\n","\"they live many a year, and their memories \n","are long, and they hand on their wisdom to their \n","children. i knew many among the ravens of the \n","\n","\n","\n","rocks when i was a dwarf-lad. this very height \n","was once named ravenhill, because there was \n","a wise and famous pair, old care and his wife, \n","that lived here above the guard-chamber. but i \n","don't suppose that any of that ancient breed \n","linger here now.\" \n","\n","no sooner had he finished speaking than \n","the old thrush gave a loud call, and immediately \n","flew away. \n","\n","\"we may not understand him, but that old \n","bird understands us, i am sure,\" said balin. \n","\"keep watch now, and see what happens!\" \n","\n","before long there was a fluttering of wings, \n","and back came the thrush; and with him came a \n","most decrepit old bird. he was getting blind, he \n","could hardly fly, and the top of his head was \n","bald. he was an aged raven of great size. he \n","alighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly \n","flapped his wings, and bobbed towards thorin. \n","\n","\"o thorin son of thrain, and balin son of \n","fundin,\" he croaked (and bilbo could \n","understand what he said, for he used ordinary \n","language and not bird-speech). \"i am roac son \n","of care. care is dead, but he was well known to \n","you once. it is a hundred years and three and \n","fifty since i came out of the egg, but i do not \n","forget what my father told me. now i am the \n","chief of the great ravens of the mountain. we \n","are few, but we remember still the king that was \n","\n","\n","\n","of old. most of my people are abroad, for there \n","are great tidings in the south - some are \n","tidings of joy to you, and some you will not think \n","so good. \n","\n","\"behold! the birds are gathering back again \n","to the mountain and to dale from south and \n","east and west, for word has gone out that \n","smaug is dead!\" \n","\n","\"dead! dead?\" shouted the dwarves. \n","\"dead! then we have been in needless fear - \n","and the treasure is ours!\" they all sprang up \n","and began to caper about for joy. \n","\n","\"yes, dead,\" said roac. \"the thrush, may \n","his feathers never fall, saw him die, and we may \n","trust his words. he saw him fall in battle with the \n","men of esgaroth the third night back from now \n","at the rising of the moon.\" \n","\n","it was some time before thorin could bring \n","the dwarves to be silent and listen to the raven's \n","news. at length when he had told all the tale of \n","the battle he went on: \n","\n","\"so much for joy, thorin oakenshield. you \n","may go back to your halls in safety; all the \n","treasure is yours - for the moment. but many \n","are gathering hither beside the birds. the news \n","of the death of the guardian has already gone \n","far and wide, and the legend of the wealth of \n","thror has not lost in the telling during many \n","years; many are eager for a share of the spoil. \n","\n","\n","\n","already a host of the elves is on the way, and \n","carrion birds are with them hoping for battle and \n","slaughter. by the lake men murmur that their \n","sorrows are due to the dwarves; for they are \n","homeless and many have died, and smaug has \n","destroyed their town. they too think to find \n","amends from your treasure, whether you are \n","alive or dead. \n","\n","\"your own wisdom must decide your \n","course; but thirteen is small remnant of the \n","great folk of durin that once dwelt here, and \n","now are scattered far. if you will listen to my \n","counsel, you will not trust the master of the \n","lake-men, but rather him that shot the dragon \n","with his bow. bard is he, of the race of dale, of \n","the line of girion; he is a grim man but true. we \n","would see peace once more among dwarves \n","and men and elves after the long desolation; but \n","it may cost you dear in gold. i have spoken.\" \n","\n","then thorin burst forth in anger: \"our \n","thanks, roac care's son. you and your people \n","shall not be forgotten. but none of our gold shall \n","thieves take or the violent carry off while we are \n","alive. if you would earn our thanks still more, \n","bring us news of any that draw near. also i \n","would beg of you, if any of you are still young \n","and strong of wing, that you would send \n","messengers to our kin in the mountains of the \n","north, both west from here and east, and tell \n","\n","\n","\n","them of our plight. but go specially to my cousin \n","dain in the iron hills, for he has many people \n","well-armed, and dwells nearest to this place. \n","bid him hasten!\" \n","\n","\"i will not say if this counsel be good or \n","bad,\" croaked roac, \"but i will do what can be \n","done.\" then off he slowly flew. \n","\n","\"back now to the mountain!\" cried thorin. \n","\"we have little time to lose.\" \n","\n","\"and little food to use!\" cried bilbo, always \n","practical on such points. in any case he felt that \n","the adventure was, properly speaking, over with \n","the death of the dragon - in which he was much \n","mistaken - and he would have given most of his \n","share of the profits for the peaceful winding up \n","of these affairs. \n","\n","\"back to the mountain!\" cried the dwarves \n","as if they had not heard him; so back he had to \n","go with them. \n","\n","\n","as you have heard some of the events already, \n","you will see that the dwarves still had some \n","days before them. they explored the caverns \n","once more, and found, as they expected, that \n","only the front gate remained open; all the other \n","gates (except, of course, the small secret door) \n","had long ago been broken and blocked by \n","\n","\n","\n","smaug, and no sign of them remained. so now \n","they began to labour hard in fortifying the main \n","entrance, and in making a new path that led \n","from it. tools were to be found in plenty that the \n","miners and quarriers and builders of old had \n","used; and at such work the dwarves were still \n","very skilled. \n","\n","as they worked the ravens brought them \n","constant tidings. in this way they learned that the \n","elvenking had turned aside to the lake, and \n","they still had a breathing space. better still, they \n","heard that three of their ponies had escaped \n","and were wandering wild far down the banks of \n","the running river, not far from where the rest of \n","their stores had been left. so while the others \n","went on with their work, fili and kili were sent, \n","guided by a raven, to find the ponies and bring \n","back all they could. \n","\n","they were four days gone, and by that time \n","they knew that the joined armies of the lake- \n","men and the elves were hurrying toward the \n","mountain. but now their hopes were higher; for \n","they had food for some weeks with care - \n","chiefly cram, of course, and they were very tired \n","of it; but cram is much better than nothing - and \n","already the gate was blocked with a wall of \n","squared stones laid dry, but very thick and high, \n","across the opening. there were holes in the \n","wall through which they could see (or shoot), but \n","\n","\n","\n","no entrance. they climbed in or out with \n","ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. for the \n","issuing of the stream they had contrived a small \n","low arch under the new wall; but near the \n","entrance they had so altered the narrow bed \n","that a wide pool stretched from the mountain- \n","wall to the head of the fall over which the stream \n","went towards dale. approach to the gate was \n","now only possible, without swimming, along a \n","narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right as one \n","looked outwards from the wall. the ponies they \n","had brought only to the head of the steps above \n","the old bridge, and unloading them there had \n","bidden them return to their masters and sent \n","them back riderless to the south. \n","\n","\n","there came a night when suddenly there were \n","many lights as of fires and torches away south \n","in dale before them. \n","\n","\"they have come!\" called balin. \"and their \n","camp is very great. they must have come into \n","the valley under the cover of dusk along both \n","banks of the river.\" \n","\n","that night the dwarves slept little. the \n","morning was still pale when they saw a \n","company approaching. from behind their wall \n","they watched them come up to the valley's head \n","\n","\n","\n","and climb slowly up. before long they could see \n","that both men of the lake armed as if for war \n","and elvish bowmen were among them. at length \n","the foremost of these climbed the tumbled \n","rocks and appeared at the top of the falls; and \n","very great was their surprise to see the pool \n","before them and the gate blocked with a wall of \n","new-hewn stone. \n","\n","as they stood pointing and speaking to one \n","another thorin hailed them: \"who are you,\" he \n","called in a very loud voice, \"that come as if in \n","war to the gates of thorin son of thrain, king \n","under the mountain, and what do you desire?\" \n","\n","but they answered nothing. some turned \n","swiftly back, and the others after gazing for a \n","while at the gate and its defences soon \n","followed them. that day the camp was moved \n","to the east of the river, right between the arms \n","of the mountain. the rocks echoed then with \n","voices and with song, as they had not done for \n","many a day. there was the sound, too, of elven- \n","harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up \n","towards them it seemed that the chill of the air \n","was warmed, and they caught faintly the \n","fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in \n","spring. \n","\n","then bilbo longed to escape from the dark \n","fortress and to go down and join in the mirth \n","and feasting by the fires. some of the younger \n","\n","\n","\n","dwarves were moved in their hearts, too, and \n","they muttered that they wished things had fallen \n","out otherwise and that they might welcome such \n","folk as friends; but thorin scowled. \n","\n","then the dwarves themselves brought forth \n","harps and instruments regained from the hoard, \n","and made music to soften his mood; but their \n","song was not as elvish song, and was much like \n","the song they had sung long before in bilbo's \n","little hobbit-hole. \n","\n","\n","under the mountain dark and tall \n","the king has come unto his hall! \n","his foe is dead, the worm of dread, \n","and ever so his foes shall fall. \n","\n","\n","the sword is sharp, the spear is long, \n","the arrow swift, the gate is strong; \n","\n","the heart is bold that looks on gold; \n","\n","the dwarves no more shall suffer wrong. \n","\n","\n","the dwarves of yore made mighty spells, \n","while hammers fell like ringing bells \n","\n","\n","\n","in places deep, where dark things sleep, \n","in hollowhalls beneath the fells. \n","\n","\n","on silver necklaces they strung \n","the light of stars, on crowns they hung \n","the dragon-fire, from twisted wire \n","the melody of harps they wrung. \n","\n","\n","the mountain throne once more is freed! \n","o! wandering folk, the summons heed! \n","come haste! come haste! across the \n","waste! \n","\n","the king of friend and kin has need. \n","\n","\n","now cal i we over mountains cold, \n","'come back unto the caverns old'! \n","here at the gates the king awaits, \n","\n","his hands are rich with gems and gold. \n","\n","\n","\n","the king is come unto his hall \n","under the mountain dark and tall. \n","\n","the worm of dread is slain and dead, \n","and ever so our foes shall fall! \n","\n","\n","this song appeared to please thorin, and \n","he smiled again and grew merry; and he began \n","reckoning the distance to the iron hills and how \n","long it would be before dain could reach the \n","lonely mountain, if he had set out as soon as \n","the message reached him. but bilbo's heart \n","fell, both at the song and the talk: they sounded \n","much too warlike. \n","\n","the next morning early a company of \n","spearmen was seen crossing the river, and \n","marching up the valley. they bore with them the \n","green banner of the elvenking and the blue \n","banner of the lake, and they advanced until \n","they stood right before the wall at the gate. \n","\n","again thorin hailed them in a loud voice: \n","\"who are you that come armed for war to the \n","gates of thorin son of thrain, king under the \n","mountain?\" this time he was answered. \n","\n","a tall man stood forward, dark of hair and \n","grim of face, and he cried: \"hail thorin! why do \n","you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? we \n","are not yet foes, and we rejoice that you are \n","alive beyond our hope. we came expecting to \n","\n","\n","\n","find none living here; yet now that we are met \n","there is matter for a parley and a council.\" \n","\n","\"who are you, and of what would you \n","parley?\" \n","\n","\"i am bard, and by my hand was the dragon \n","slain and your treasure delivered. is that not a \n","matter that concerns you? moreover i am by \n","right descent the heir of girion of dale, and in \n","your hoard is mingled much of the wealth of his \n","halls and towns, which of old smaug stole. is \n","not that a matter of which we may speak? \n","further in his last battle smaug destroyed the \n","dwellings of the men of esgaroth, and i am yet \n","the servant of their master. i would speak for \n","him and ask whether you have no thought for \n","the sorrow and misery of his people. they \n","aided you in your distress, and in recompense \n","you have thus far brought ruin only, though \n","doubtless undesigned.\" \n","\n","now these were fair words and true, if \n","proudly and grimly spoken; and bilbo thought \n","that thorin would at once admit what justice \n","was in them. he did not, of course, expect that \n","any one would remember that it was he who \n","discovered all by himself the dragon's weak \n","spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever \n","did. but also he did not reckon with the power \n","that gold has upon which a dragon has long \n","brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. long hours \n","\n","\n","in the past days thorin had spent in the \n","treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. \n","though he had hunted chiefly for the \n","arkenstone, yet he had an eye for many another \n","wonderful thing that was lying there, about which \n","were wound old memories of the labours and \n","the sorrows of his race. \n","\n","\"you put your worst cause last and in the \n","chief place,\" thorin answered. \"to the treasure \n","of my people no man has a claim, because \n","smaug who stole it from us also robbed him of \n","life or home. the treasure was not his that his \n","evil deeds should be amended with a share of \n","it. the price of the goods and the assistance \n","that we received of the lake-men we will fairly \n","pay - in due time. but nothing will we give, not \n","even a loafs worth, under threat offeree. while \n","an armed host lies before our doors, we look on \n","you as foes and thieves. \n","\n","\"it is in my mind to ask what share of their \n","inheritance you would have paid to our kindred, \n","had you found the hoard unguarded and us \n","slain.\" \n","\n","\"a just question,\" replied bard. \"but you are \n","not dead, and we are not robbers. moreover the \n","wealthy may have pity beyond right on the \n","needy that befriended them when they were in \n","want. and still my other claims remain \n","\n","\n","unanswered.\" \n","\n","\"i will not parley, as i have said, with armed \n","men at my gate. nor at all with the people of the \n","elvenking, whom i remember with small \n","kindness. in this debate they have no place. \n","begone now ere our arrows fly! and if you \n","would speak with me again, first dismiss the \n","elvish host to the woods where it belongs, and \n","then return, laying down your arms before you \n","approach the threshold.\" \n","\n","\"the elvenking is my friend, and he has \n","succoured the people of the lake in their need, \n","though they had no claim but friendship on him,\" \n","answered bard. \"we will give you time to repent \n","your words. gather your wisdom ere we return!\" \n","then he departed and went back to the camp. \n","\n","ere many hours were past, the banner- \n","bearers returned, and trumpeters stood forth \n","and blew a blast: \n","\n","\"in the name of esgaroth and the forest,\" \n","one cried, \"we speak unto thorin thrain's son \n","oakenshield, calling himself the king under the \n","mountain, and we bid him consider well the \n","claims that have been urged, or be declared \n","our foe. at the least he shall deliver one twelfth \n","portion of the treasure unto bard, as the \n","dragon-slayer, and as the heir of girion. from \n","that portion bard will himself contribute to the \n","aid of esgaroth; but if thorin would have the \n","\n","\n","\n","friendship and honour of the lands about, as his \n","sires had of old, then he will give also \n","somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men \n","of the lake.\" \n","\n","then thorin seized a bow of horn and shot \n","an arrow at the speaker. it smote into his shield \n","and stuck there quivering. \n","\n","\"since such is your answer,\" he called in \n","return, \"i declare the mountain besieged. you \n","shall not depart from it, until you call on your \n","side for a truce and a parley. we will bear no \n","weapons against you, but we leave you to your \n","gold. you may eat that, if you will!\" \n","\n","with that the messengers departed swiftly, \n","and the dwarves were left to consider their \n","case. so grim had thorin become, that even if \n","they had wished, the others would not have \n","dared to find fault with him; but indeed most of \n","them seemed to share his mind - except \n","perhaps old fat bomburand fili and kili. bilbo, \n","of course, disapproved of the whole turn of \n","affairs. he had by now had more than enough of \n","the mountain, and being besieged inside it was \n","not at all to his taste. \n","\n","\"the whole place still stinks of dragon,\" he \n","grumbled to himself, \"and it makes me sick. \n","and cram is beginning simply to stick in my \n","throat.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter xvi \n","\n","\n","a thief in the night \n","\n","\n","now the days passed slowly and wearily. many \n","of the dwarves spent their time piling and \n","ordering the treasure; and now thorin spoke of \n","the arkenstone of thrain, and bade them \n","eagerly to look for it in every corner. \n","\n","\"for the arkenstone of my father,\" he said, \n","\"is worth more than a river of gold in itself, and \n","to me it is beyond price. that stone of all the \n","treasure i name unto myself, and i will be \n","avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds \n","it.\" \n","\n","bilbo heard these words and he grew \n","afraid, wondering what would happen, if the \n","stone was found - wrapped in an old bundle of \n","tattered oddments that he used as a pillow. all \n","the same he did not speak of it, for as the \n","weariness of the days grew heavier, the \n","beginnings of a plan had come into his little \n","head. \n","\n","\n","things had gone on like this for some time, \n","when the ravens brought news that dain and \n","more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from \n","the iron hills, were now within about two days' \n","march of dale, coming from the north-east. \n","\n","\"but they cannot reach the mountain \n","unmarked,\" said roac, \"and i fear lest there be \n","battle in the valley. i do not call this counsel \n","good. though they are a grim folk, they are not \n","likely to overcome the host that besets you; and \n","even if they did so, what will you gain? winter \n","and snow is hastening behind them. how shall \n","you be fed without the friendship and goodwill \n","of the lands about you? the treasure is likely to \n","be your death, though the dragon is no more!\" \n","\n","but thorin was not moved. \"winter and \n","snow will bite both men and elves,\" he said, \n","\"and they may find their dwelling in the waste \n","grievous to bear. with my friends behind them \n","and winter upon them, they will perhaps be in \n","softer mood to parley with.\" \n","\n","that night bilbo made up his mind. the sky \n","was black and moonless. as soon as it was full \n","dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber \n","just within the gate and drew from his bundle a \n","rope, and also the arkenstone wrapped in a \n","rag. then he climbed to the top of the wall. only \n","bombur was there, for it was his turn to watch, \n","and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a \n","\n","\n","\n","time. \n","\n","\"it is mighty cold!\" said bombur. \"i wish we \n","could have a fire up here as they have in the \n","camp!\" \n","\n","\"it is warm enough inside,\" said bilbo. \n","\n","\"i daresay; but i am bound here till \n","midnight,\" grumbled the fat dwarf. \"a sorry \n","business altogether. not that i venture to \n","disagree with thorin, may his beard grow ever \n","longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff \n","neck.\" \n","\n","\"not as stiff as my legs,\" said bilbo. \"i am \n","tired of stairs and stone passages. i would give \n","a good deal for the feel of grass at my toes.\" \n","\n","\"i would give a good deal for the feel of a \n","strong drink in my throat, and for a soft bed after \n","a good supper!\" \n","\n","\"i can't give you those, while the siege is \n","going on. but it is long since i watched, and i will \n","take your turn for you, if you like. there is no \n","sleep in me tonight.\" \n","\n","\"you are a good fellow, mr. baggins, and i \n","will take your offer kindly. if there should be \n","anything to note, rouse me first, mind you! i will \n","lie in the inner chamber to the left, not far away.\" \n","\n","\"off you go!\" said bilbo. \"i will wake you at \n","midnight, and you can wake the next \n","watchman.\" \n","\n","as soon as bombur had gone, bilbo put on \n","\n","\n","\n","his ring, fastened his rope, slipped down over \n","the wall, and was gone. he had about five hours \n","before him. bombur would sleep (he could \n","sleep at any time, and ever since the adventure \n","in the forest he was always trying to recapture \n","the beautiful dreams he had then); and all the \n","others were busy with thorin. it was unlikely that \n","any, even fili or kili, would come out on the wall \n","until it was their turn. \n","\n","it was very dark, and the road after a while, \n","when he left the newly made path and climbed \n","down towards the lower course of the stream, \n","was strange to him. at last he came to the bend \n","where he had to cross the water, if he was to \n","make for the camp, as he wished. the bed of \n","the stream was there shallow but already broad, \n","and fording it in the dark was not easy for the \n","little hobbit. he was nearly across when he \n","missed his footing on a round stone and fell into \n","the cold water with a splash. he had barely \n","scrambled out on the far bank, shivering and \n","spluttering, when up came elves in the gloom \n","with bright lanterns and searched for the cause \n","of the noise. \n","\n","\"that was no fish!\" one said. \"there is a spy \n","about. hide your lights! they will help him more \n","than us, if it is that queer little creature that is \n","said to be their servant.\" \n","\n","\"servant, indeed!\" snorted bilbo; and in the \n","\n","\n","\n","middle of his snort he sneezed loudly, and the \n","elves immediately gathered towards the sound. \n","\n","\"let's have a light!\" he said. \"i am here, if \n","you want me!\" and he slipped off his ring, and \n","popped from behind a rock. \n","\n","they seized him quickly, in spite of their \n","surprise. \"who are you? are you the dwarves' \n","hobbit? what are you doing? how did you get \n","so far past our sentinels?\" they asked one after \n","another. \n","\n","\"i am mr. bilbo baggins,\" he answered, \n","\"companion of thorin, if you want to know. i \n","know your king well by sight, though perhaps he \n","doesn't know me to look at. but bard will \n","remember me, and it is bard i particularly want \n","to see.\" \n","\n","\"indeed!\" said they, \"and what may be your \n","business?\" \n","\n","\"whatever it is, it's my own, my good elves. \n","but if you wish ever to get back to your own \n","woods from this cold cheerless place,\" he \n","answered shivering, \"you will take me along \n","quick to a fire, where i can dry - and then you \n","will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as may \n","be. i have only an hour or two to spare.\" \n","\n","\n","that is how it came about that some two hours \n","\n","\n","\n","after his escape from the gate, bilbo was \n","sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent, \n","and there sat too, gazing curiously at him, both \n","the elvenking and bard. a hobbit in elvish \n","armour, partly wrapped in an old blanket, was \n","something new to them. \n","\n","\"really you know,\" bilbo was saying in his \n","best business manner, \"things are impossible. \n","personally i am tired of the whole affair. i wish i \n","was back in the west in my own home, where \n","folk are more reasonable. but i have an interest \n","in this matter - one fourteenth share, to be \n","precise, according to a letter, which fortunately i \n","believe i have kept.\" he drew from a pocket in \n","his old jacket (which he still wore over his mail), \n","crumpled and much folded, thorin's letter that \n","had been put under the clock on his \n","mantelpiece in may! \n","\n","\"a share in the profits, mind you,\" he went \n","on. \"i am aware of that. personally i am only too \n","ready to consider all your claims carefully, and \n","deduct what is right from the total before putting \n","in my own claim. however you don't know \n","thorin oakenshield as well as i do now. i \n","assure you, he is quite ready to sit on a heap of \n","gold and starve, as long as you sit here.\" \n","\n","\"well, let him!\" said bard. \"such a fool \n","deserves to starve.\" \n","\n","\"quite so,\" said bilbo. \"i see your point of \n","\n","\n","\n","view. at the same time winter is coming on fast. \n","before long you will be having snow and what \n","not, and supplies will be difficult - even for elves \n","i imagine. also there will be other difficulties. \n","you have not heard of dain and the dwarves of \n","the iron hills?\" \n","\n","\"we have, a long time ago; but what has he \n","got to do with us?\" asked the king. \n","\n","\"i thought as much. i see i have some \n","information you have not got. dain, i may tell \n","you, is now less than two days' march off, and \n","has at least five hundred grim dwarves with him \n","- a good many of them have had experience in \n","the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, of which you \n","have no doubt heard. when they arrive there \n","may be serious trouble.\" \n","\n","\"why do you tell us this? are you betraying \n","your friends, or are you threatening us?\" asked \n","bard grimly. \n","\n","\"my dear bard!\" squeaked bilbo. \"don't be \n","so hasty! i never met such suspicious folk! i am \n","merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. \n","now i will make you an offer! !\" \n","\n","\"let us hear it!\" they said. \n","\n","\"you may see it!\" said he. \"it is this!\" and he \n","drew forth the arkenstone, and threw away the \n","wrapping. \n","\n","the elvenking himself, whose eyes were \n","used to things of wonder and beauty, stood up \n","\n","\n","\n","in amazement. even bard gazed marvelling at it \n","in silence. it was as if a globe had been filled \n","with moonlight and hung before them in a net \n","woven of the glint of frosty stars. \n","\n","\"this is the arkenstone of thrain,\" said \n","bilbo, \"the heart of the mountain; and it is also \n","the heart of thorin. he values it above a river of \n","gold. i give it to you. it will aid you in your \n","bargaining.\" then bilbo, not without a shudder, \n","not without a glance of longing, handed the \n","marvellous stone to bard, and he held it in his \n","hand, as though dazed. \n","\n","\"but how is it yours to give?\" he asked at \n","last with an effort. \n","\n","\"o well!\" said the hobbit uncomfortably. \"it \n","isn't exactly; but, well, i am willing to let it stand \n","against all my claim, don't you know. i may be a \n","burglar - or so they say: personally i never really \n","felt like one - but i am an honest one, i hope, \n","more or less. anyway i am going back now, and \n","the dwarves can do what they like to me. i hope \n","you will find it useful.\" \n","\n","the elvenking looked at bilbo with a new \n","wonder. \"bilbo baggins!\" he said. \"you are \n","more worthy to wear the armour of elf-princes \n","than many that have looked more comely in it. \n","but i wonder if thorin oakenshield will see it so. \n","i have more knowledge of dwarves in general \n","than you have perhaps. i advise you to remain \n","\n","\n","\n","with us, and here you shall be honoured and \n","thrice welcome.\" \n","\n","\"thank you very much i am sure,\" said bilbo \n","with a bow. \"but i don't think i ought to leave my \n","friends like this, after all we have gone through \n","together. and i promised to wake old bombur \n","at midnight, too! really i must be going, and \n","quickly.\" \n","\n","nothing they could say would stop him; so \n","an escort was provided for him, and as he went \n","both the king and bard saluted him with honour. \n","as they passed through the camp an old man, \n","wrapped in a dark cloak, rose from a tent door \n","where he was sitting and came towards them. \n","\n","\"well done! mr. baggins!\" he said, clapping \n","bilbo on the back. \"there is always more about \n","you than anyone expects!\" it was gandalf. \n","\n","for the first time for many a day bilbo was \n","really delighted. but there was no time for all the \n","questions that he immediately wished to ask. \n","\n","\"all in good time!\" said gandalf. \"things are \n","drawing towards the end now, unless i am \n","mistaken. there is an unpleasant time just in \n","front of you; but keep your heart up! you may \n","come through all right. there is news brewing \n","that even the ravens have not heard. good \n","night!\" \n","\n","puzzled but cheered, bilbo hurried on. he \n","was guided to a safe ford and set across dry, \n","\n","\n","\n","and then he said farewell to the elves and \n","climbed carefully back towards the gate. great \n","weariness began to come over him; but it was \n","well before midnight when he clambered up the \n","rope again - it was still where he had left it. he \n","untied it and hid it, and then he sat down on the \n","wall and wondered anxiously what would \n","happen next. \n","\n","at midnight he woke up bombur; and then \n","in turn rolled himself up in his corner, without \n","listening to the old dwarfs thanks (which he felt \n","he had hardly earned). he was soon fast asleep \n","forgetting all his worries till the morning. as a \n","matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and \n","bacon. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter xvii \n","\n","\n","the clouds burst \n","\n","\n","next day the trumpets rang early in the camp. \n","soon a single runner was seen hurrying along \n","the narrow path. at a distance he stood and \n","hailed them, asking whether thorin would now \n","listen to another embassy, since new tidings \n","had come to hand, and matters were changed. \n","\n","\"that will be dain!\" said thorin when he \n","heard. \"they will have got wind of his coming. i \n","thought that would alter their mood! bid them \n","come few in number and weaponless, and i will \n","hear,\" he called to the messenger. \n","\n","about midday the banners of the forest \n","and the lake were seen to be borne forth \n","again. a company of twenty was approaching. \n","at the beginning of the narrow way they laid \n","aside sword and spear, and came on towards \n","the gate. wondering, the dwarves saw that \n","among them were both bard and the elvenking, \n","before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and \n","\n","\n","hood bore a strong casket of iron-bound wood. \n","\n","\"hail thorin!\" said bard. \"are you still of the \n","same mind?\" \n","\n","\"my mind does not change with the rising \n","and setting of a few suns,\" answered thorin. \n","\"did you come to ask me idle questions? still \n","the elf-host has not departed as i bade! till then \n","you come in vain to bargain with me.\" \n","\n","\"is there then nothing for which you would \n","yield any of your gold?\" \n","\n","\"nothing that you or your friends have to \n","offer.\" \n","\n","\"what of the arkenstone of thrain?\" said \n","he, and at the same moment the old man \n","opened the casket and held aloft the jewel. the \n","light leapt from his hand, bright and white in the \n","morning. \n","\n","then thorin was stricken dumb with \n","amazement and confusion. no one spoke for a \n","long while. \n","\n","thorin at length broke the silence, and his \n","voice was thick with wrath. \"that stone was my \n","father's, and is mine,\" he said. \"why should i \n","purchase my own?\" but wonder overcame him \n","and he added: \"but how came you by the \n","heirloom of my house - if there is need to ask \n","such a question of thieves?\" \n","\n","\"we are not thieves,\" bard answered. \"your \n","own we will give back in return for our own.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"how came you by it?\" shouted thorin in \n","gathering rage. \n","\n","\"i gave it to them!\" squeaked bilbo, who \n","was peering over the wall, by now in a dreadful \n","fright. \n","\n","\"you! you!\" cried thorin, turning upon him \n","and grasping him with both hands. \"you \n","miserable hobbit! you undersized - burglar!\" he \n","shouted at a loss for words, and he shook poor \n","bilbo like a rabbit. \n","\n","\"by the beard of durin! i wish i had gandalf \n","here! curse him for his choice of you! may his \n","beard wither! as for you i will throw you to the \n","rocks!\" he cried and lifted bilbo in his arms. \n","\n","\"stay! your wish is granted!\" said a voice. \n","the old man with the casket threw aside his \n","hood and cloak. \"here is gandalf! and none too \n","soon it seems. if you don't like my burglar, \n","please don't damage him. put him down, and \n","listen first to what he has to say!\" \n","\n","\"you all seem in league!\" said thorin \n","dropping bilbo on the top of the wall. \"never \n","again will i have dealings with any wizard or his \n","friends. what have you to say, you descendant \n","of rats?\" \n","\n","\"dear me! dear me!\" said bilbo. \"i am sure \n","this is all very uncomfortable. you may \n","remember saying that i might choose my own \n","fourteenth share? perhaps i took it too literally \n","\n","\n","\n","- i have been told that dwarves are sometimes \n","politer in word than in deed. the time was, all \n","the same, when you seemed to think that i had \n","been of some service. descendant of rats, \n","indeed! is this all the service of you and your \n","family that i was promised, thorin? take it that i \n","have disposed of my share as i wished, and let \n","it go at that!\" \n","\n","\"i will,\" said thorin grimly. \"and i will let you \n","go at that - and may we never meet again!\" \n","then he turned and spoke over the wall. \"i am \n","betrayed,\" he said. \"it was rightly guessed that i \n","could not forbear to redeem the arkenstone, the \n","treasure of my house. for it i will give one \n","fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, \n","setting aside the gems; but that shall be \n","accounted the promised share of this traitor, \n","and with that reward he shall depart, and you \n","can divide it as you will. he will get little enough, \n","i doubt not. take him, if you wish him to live; \n","and no friendship of mine goes with him. \n","\n","\"get down now to your friends!\" he said to \n","bilbo, \"or i will throw you down.\" \n","\n","\"what about the gold and silver?\" asked \n","bilbo. \n","\n","\"that shall follow after, as can be arranged,\" \n","said he. \"get down!\" \n","\n","\"until then we keep the stone,\" cried bard. \n","\n","\"you are not making a very splendid figure \n","\n","\n","\n","as king under the mountain,\" said gandalf. \"but \n","things may change yet.\" \n","\n","\"they may indeed,\" said thorin. and \n","already, so strong was the bewilderment of the \n","treasure upon him, he was pondering whether \n","by the help of dain he might not recapture the \n","arkenstone and withhold the share of the \n","reward. \n","\n","and so bilbo was swung down from the \n","wall, and departed with nothing for all his \n","trouble, except the armour which thorin had \n","given him already. more than one of the \n","dwarves in their hearts felt shame and pity at \n","his going. \n","\n","\"farewell!\" he cried to them. \"we may meet \n","again as friends.\" \n","\n","\"be off!\" called thorin. \"you have mail upon \n","you, which was made by my folk, and is too \n","good for you. it cannot be pierced by arrows; \n","but if you do not hasten, i will sting your \n","miserable feet. so be swift!\" \n","\n","\"not so hasty!\" said bard. \"we will give you \n","until tomorrow. at noon we will return, and see if \n","you have brought from the hoard the portion that \n","is to be set against the stone. if that is done \n","without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf- \n","host will go back to the forest. in the meanwhile \n","farewell!\" \n","\n","with that they went back to the camp; but \n","\n","\n","\n","thorin sent messengers by roac telling dain of \n","what had passed, and bidding him come with \n","wary speed. \n","\n","\n","that day passed and the night. the next day the \n","wind shifted west, and the air was dark and \n","gloomy. the morning was still early when a cry \n","was heard in the camp. runners came in to \n","report that a host of dwarves had appeared \n","round the eastern spur of the mountain and was \n","now hastening to dale. dain had come. he had \n","hurried on through the night, and so had come \n","upon them sooner than they had expected. \n","each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of \n","steel mail that hung to his knees, and his legs \n","were covered with hose of a fine and flexible \n","metal mesh, the secret of whose making was \n","possessed by dain's people. the dwarves are \n","exceedingly strong for their height, but most of \n","these were strong even for dwarves. in battle \n","they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but \n","each of them had also a short broad sword at \n","his side and a roundshield slung at his back. \n","their beards were forked and plaited and thrust \n","into their belts. their caps were of iron and they \n","were shod with iron, and their faces were grim. \n","\n","trumpets called men and elves to arms. \n","\n","\n","\n","before long the dwarves could be seen coming \n","up the valley at a great pace. they halted \n","between the river and the eastern spur; but a \n","few held on their way, and crossing the river \n","drew near the camp; and there they laid down \n","their weapons and held up their hands in sign of \n","peace. bard went out to meet them, and with \n","him went bilbo. \n","\n","\"we are sent from dain son of nain,\" they \n","said when questioned. \"we are hastening to \n","our kinsmen in the mountain, since we learn that \n","the kingdom of old is renewed. but who are you \n","that sit in the plain as foes before defended \n","walls?\" this, of course, in the polite and rather \n","old-fashioned language of such occasions, \n","meant simply: \"you have no business here. we \n","are going on, so make way or we shall fight \n","you!\" they meant to push on between the \n","mountain and the loop of the river; for the \n","narrow land there did not seem to be strongly \n","guarded. \n","\n","bard, of course, refused to allow the \n","dwarves to go straight on to the mountain. he \n","was determined to wait until the gold and silver \n","had been brought out in exchange for the \n","arkenstone; for he did not believe that this \n","would be done, if once the fortress was manned \n","with so large and warlike a company. they had \n","brought with them a great store of supplies; for \n","\n","\n","\n","the dwarves can carry very heavy burdens, and \n","nearly all of dain's folk, in spite of their rapid \n","march, bore huge packs on their backs in \n","addition to their weapons. they would stand a \n","siege for weeks, and by that time yet more \n","dwarves might come, and yet more, for thorin \n","had many relatives. also they would be able to \n","reopen and guard some other gate, so that the \n","besiegers would have to encircle the whole \n","mountain; and for that they had not sufficient \n","numbers. \n","\n","these were, in fact, precisely their plans \n","(for the raven-messengers had been busy \n","between thorin and dain); but for the moment \n","the way was barred, so after angry words the \n","dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their \n","beards. bard then sent messengers at once to \n","the gate; but they found no gold or payment. \n","arrows came forth as soon as they were within \n","shot, and they hastened back in dismay. in the \n","camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the \n","dwarves of dain were advancing along the \n","eastern bank. \n","\n","\"fools!\" laughed bard, \"to come thus \n","beneath the mountain's arm! they do not \n","understand war above ground, whatever they \n","may know of battle in the mines. there are \n","many of our archers and spearmen now hidden \n","in the rocks upon their right flank. dwarf-mail \n","\n","\n","\n","may be good, but they will soon be hard put to \n","it. let us set on them now from both sides, \n","before they are fully rested!\" \n","\n","but the elvenking said: \"long will i tarry, ere \n","i begin this war for gold. the dwarves cannot \n","pass us, unless we will, or do anything that we \n","cannot mark. let us hope still for something that \n","will bring reconciliation. our advantage in \n","numbers will be enough, if in the end it must \n","come to unhappy blows.\" \n","\n","but he reckoned without the dwarves. the \n","knowledge that the arkenstone was in the \n","hands of the besiegers burned in their thoughts; \n","also they guessed the hesitation of bard and \n","his friends, and resolved to strike while they \n","debated. \n","\n","suddenly without a signal they sprang \n","silently forward to attack. bows twanged and \n","arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined. \n","\n","still more suddenly a darkness came on \n","with dreadful swiftness! a black cloud hurried \n","over the sky. winter thunder on a wild wind \n","rolled roaring up and rumbled in the mountain, \n","and lightning lit its peak. and beneath the \n","thunder another blackness could be seen \n","whirling forward; but it did not come with the \n","wind, it came from the north, like a vast cloud of \n","birds, so dense that no light could be seen \n","between their wings. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"halt!\" cried gandalf, who appeared \n","suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, \n","between the advancing dwarves and the ranks \n","awaiting them. \"halt!\" he called in a voice like \n","thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash \n","like the lightning. \"dread has come upon you \n","all! alas! it has come more swiftly than i \n","guessed. the goblins are upon you! bolg- of \n","the north is coming, o dain! whose father you \n","slew in moria. behold! the bats are above his \n","army like a sea of locusts. they ride upon \n","wolves and wargs are in their train!\" \n","\n","amazement and confusion fell upon them \n","all. even as gandalf had been speaking the \n","darkness grew. the dwarves halted and gazed \n","at the sky. the elves cried out with many voices. \n","\n","\"come!\" called gandalf. \"there is yet time \n","for council. let dain son of nain come swiftly to \n","us!\" \n","\n","\n","so began a battle that none had expected; and \n","it was called the battle of five armies, and it \n","was very terrible. upon one side were the \n","goblins and the wild wolves, and upon the \n","other were elves and men and dwarves. this is \n","how it fell out. ever since the fall of the great \n","goblin of the misty mountains the hatred of their \n","\n","\n","race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury. \n","messengers had passed to and fro between all \n","their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they \n","resolved now to win the dominion of the north. \n","tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and \n","in all the mountains there was a forging and an \n","arming. then they marched and gathered by hill \n","and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, \n","until around and beneath the great mountain \n","gundabad of the north, where was their capital, \n","a vast host was assembled ready to sweep \n","down in time of storm unawares upon the \n","south. then they learned of the death of \n","smaug, and joy was in their hearts; and they \n","hastened night after night through the \n","mountains, and came thus at last on a sudden \n","from the north hard on the heels of dain. not \n","even the ravens knew of their coming until they \n","came out in the broken lands which divided the \n","lonely mountain from the hills behind. how \n","much gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is \n","plain that he had not expected this sudden \n","assault. \n","\n","this is the plan that he made in council with \n","the elven-king and with bard; and with dain, for \n","the dwarf-lord now joined them: the goblins \n","were the foes of all, and at their coming all other \n","quarrels were forgotten. their only hope was to \n","lure the goblins into the valley between the arms \n","\n","\n","\n","of the mountain; and themselves to man the \n","great spurs that struck south and east. yet this \n","would be perilous, if the goblins were in \n","sufficient numbers to overrun the mountain \n","itself, and so attack them also from behind and \n","above; but there was no time to make any other \n","plan, or to summon any help. \n","\n","soon the thunder passed, rolling away to \n","the south-east; but the bat-cloud came, flying \n","lower, over the shoulder of the mountain, and \n","whirled above them shutting out the light and \n","filling them with dread. \n","\n","\"to the mountain!\" called bard. \"to the \n","mountain! let us take our places while there is \n","yet time!\" \n","\n","on the southern spur, in its lower slopes \n","and in the rocks at its feet, the elves were set; \n","on the eastern spur were men and dwarves. \n","but bard and some of the nimblest of men and \n","elves climbed to the height of the eastern \n","shoulder to gain a view to the north. soon they \n","could see the lands before the mountain's feet \n","black with a hurrying multitude. ere long the \n","vanguard swirled round the spur's end and \n","came rushing into dale. these were the \n","swiftest wolf-riders, and already their cries and \n","howls rent the air afar. a few brave men were \n","strung before them to make a feint of \n","resistance, and many there fell before the rest \n","\n","\n","\n","drew back and fled to either side. as gandalf \n","had hoped, the goblin army had gathered \n","behind the resisted vanguard, and poured now \n","in rage into the valley, driving wildly up between \n","the arms of the mountain, seeking for the foe. \n","their banners were countless, black and red, \n","and they came on like a tide in fury and \n","disorder. \n","\n","it was a terrible battle. the most dreadful of \n","all bilbo's experiences, and the one which at \n","the time he hated most - which is to say it was \n","the one he was most proud of, and most fond of \n","recalling long afterwards, although he was quite \n","unimportant in it. actually i may say he put on \n","his ring early in the business, and vanished \n","from sight, if not from all danger. a magic ring \n","of that sort is not a complete protection in a \n","goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows \n","and wild spears; but it does help in getting out \n","of the way, and it prevents your head from being \n","specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a \n","goblin swordsman. \n","\n","the elves were the first to charge. their \n","hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. their \n","spears and swords shone in the gloom with a \n","gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of \n","the hands that held them. as soon as the host of \n","their enemies was dense in the valley, they sent \n","against it a shower of arrows, and each \n","\n","\n","\n","flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. behind \n","the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt \n","down and charged. the yells were deafening. \n","the rocks were stained black with goblin blood. \n","\n","just as the goblins were recovering from \n","the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, \n","there rose from across the valley a deep- \n","throated roar. with cries of \"moria!\" and \"dain, \n","dain!\" the dwarves of the iron hills plunged in, \n","wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; \n","and beside them came the men of the lake \n","with long swords. \n","\n","panic came upon the goblins; and even as \n","they turned to meet this new attack, the elves \n","charged again with renewed numbers. already \n","many of the goblins were flying back down the \n","river to escape from the trap; and many of their \n","own wolves were turning upon them and \n","rending the dead and the wounded. victory \n","seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on the \n","heights above. \n","\n","goblins had scaled the mountain from the \n","other side and already many were on the \n","slopes above the gate, and others were \n","streaming down recklessly, heedless of those \n","that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to \n","attack the spurs from above. each of these \n","could be reached by paths that ran down from \n","the main mass of the mountain in the centre; \n","\n","\n","\n","and the defenders had too few to bar the way \n","for long. victory now vanished from hope. they \n","had only stemmed the first onslaught of the \n","black tide. \n","\n","day drew on. the goblins gathered again in \n","the valley. there a host of wargs came \n","ravening and with them came the bodyguard of \n","bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of \n","steel. soon actual darkness was coming into a \n","stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled \n","about the heads and ears of elves and men, or \n","fastened vampire-like on the stricken. now \n","bard was fighting to defend the eastern spur, \n","and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords \n","were at bay about their king upon the southern \n","arm, near to the watch-post on ravenhill. \n","\n","suddenly there was a great shout, and from \n","the gate came a trumpet call. they had \n","forgotten thorin! part of the wall, moved by \n","levers, fell outward with a crash into the pool. \n","out leapt the king under the mountain, and his \n","companions followed him. hood and cloak \n","were gone; they were in shining armour, and \n","red light leapt from their eyes. in the gloom the \n","great dwarf gleamed like gold in a dying fire. \n","\n","rocks were hurled down from on high by \n","the goblins above; but they held on, leapt down \n","to the falls' foot, and rushed forward to battle. \n","wolf and rider fell or fled before them. thorin \n","\n","\n","\n","wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and \n","nothing seemed to harm him. \n","\n","\"to me! to me! elves and men! to me! o \n","my kinsfolk!\" he cried, and his voice shook like \n","a horn in the valley. \n","\n","down, heedless of order, rushed all the \n","dwarves of dain to his help. down too came \n","many of the lake-men, for bard could not \n","restrain them; and out upon the other side came \n","many of the spearmen of the elves. once again \n","the goblins were stricken in the valley; and they \n","were piled in heaps till dale was dark and \n","hideous with their corpses. the wargs were \n","scattered and thorin drove right against the \n","bodyguard of bolg. but he could not pierce their \n","ranks. \n","\n","already behind him among the goblin dead \n","lay many men and many dwarves, and many a \n","fair elf that should have lived yet long ages \n","merrily in the wood. and as the valley widened \n","his onset grew ever slower. his numbers were \n","too few. his flanks were unguarded. soon the \n","attackers were attacked, and they were forced \n","into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all \n","about with goblins and wolves returning to the \n","assault. the bodyguard of bolg came howling \n","against them, and drove in upon their ranks like \n","waves upon cliffs of sand. their friends could \n","not help them, for the assault from the mountain \n","\n","\n","\n","was renewed with redoubled force, and upon \n","either side men and elves were being slowly \n","beaten down. \n","\n","on all this bilbo looked with misery. he had \n","taken his stand on ravenhill among the elves - \n","partly because there was more chance of \n","escape from that point, and partly (with the \n","more tookish part of his mind) because if he \n","was going to be in a last desperate stand, he \n","preferred on the whole to defend the elvenking. \n","gandalf, too, i may say, was there, sitting on the \n","ground as if in deep thought, preparing, i \n","suppose, some last blast of magic before the \n","end. \n","\n","that did not seem far off. \"it will not be long \n","now,\" thought bilbo, \"before the goblins win the \n","gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down \n","and captured. really it is enough to make one \n","weep, after all one has gone through. i would \n","rather old smaug had been left with all the \n","wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures \n","should get it, and poor old bombur, and balin \n","and fili and kili and all the rest come to a bad \n","end; and bard too, and the lake-men and the \n","merry elves. misery me! i have heard songs of \n","many battles, and i have always understood that \n","defeat may be glorious. it seems very \n","uncomfortable, not to say distressing. i wish i \n","was well out of it.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","the clouds were torn by the wind, and a red \n","sunset slashed the west. seeing the sudden \n","gleam in the gloom bilbo looked round. he \n","gave a great cry: he had seen a sight that made \n","his heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic \n","against the distant glow. \n","\n","\"the eagles! the eagles!\" he shouted. \"the \n","eagles are coming!\" \n","\n","bilbo's eyes were seldom wrong. the \n","eagles were coming down the wind, line after \n","line, in such a host as must have gathered from \n","all the eyries of the north. \n","\n","\"the eagles! the eagles!\" bilbo cried, \n","dancing and waving his arms. if the elves could \n","not see him they could hear him. soon they too \n","took up the cry, and it echoed across the valley. \n","many wondering eyes looked up, though as yet \n","nothing could be seen except from the southern \n","shoulders of the mountain. \n","\n","\"the eagles!\" cried bilbo once more, but at \n","that moment a stone hurtling from above smote \n","heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and \n","knew no more. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter xviii \n","\n","\n","the return journey \n","\n","\n","when bilbo came to himself, he was literally by \n","himself. he was lying on the flat stones of \n","ravenhill, and no one was near. a cloudless \n","day, but cold, was broad above him. he was \n","shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head \n","burned with fire. \n","\n","\"now i wonder what has happened?\" he \n","said to himself. \"at any rate i am not yet one of \n","the fallen heroes; but i suppose there is still time \n","enough for that!\" \n","\n","he sat up painfully. looking into the valley \n","he could see no living goblins. after a while as \n","his head cleared a little, he thought he could \n","see elves moving in the rocks below. he \n","rubbed his eyes. surely there was a camp still \n","in the plain some distance off; and there was a \n","coming and going about the gate? dwarves \n","seemed to be busy removing the wall. but all \n","was deadly still. there was no call and no echo \n","\n","\n","of a song. sorrow seemed to be in the air. \n","\n","\"victory after all, i suppose!\" he said, feeling \n","his aching head. \"well, it seems a very gloomy \n","business.\" \n","\n","suddenly he was aware of a man climbing \n","up and coming towards him. \n","\n","\"hullo there!\" he called with a shaky voice. \n","\"hullo there! what news?\" \n","\n","\"what voice is it that speaks among the \n","stones?\" said the man halting and peering \n","about him not far from where bilbo sat. \n","\n","then bilbo remembered his ring! \"well i'm \n","blessed!\" said he. \"this invisibility has its \n","drawbacks after all. otherwise i suppose i might \n","have spent a warm and comfortable night in \n","bed!\" \n","\n","\"it's me, bilbo baggins, companion of \n","thorin!\" he cried, hurriedly taking off the ring. \n","\n","\"it is well that i have found you!\" said the \n","man striding forward. \"you are needed and we \n","have looked for you long. you would have been \n","numbered among the dead, who are many, if \n","gandalf the wizard had not said that your voice \n","was last heard in this place. i have been sent to \n","look here for the last time. are you much hurt?\" \n","\n","\"a nasty knock on the head, i think,\" said \n","bilbo. \"but i have a helm and a hard skull. all the \n","same i feel sick and my legs are like straws.\" \n","\n","\"i will carry you down to the camp in the \n","\n","\n","\n","valley,\" said the man, and picked him lightly up. \n","\n","the man was swift and sure-footed. it was \n","not long before bilbo was set down before a \n","tent in dale; and there stood gandalf, with his \n","arm in a sling. even the wizard had not \n","escaped without a wound; and there were few \n","unharmed in all the host. \n","\n","when gandalf saw bilbo, he was delighted. \n","\"baggins!\" he exclaimed. \"well i never! alive \n","after all - i am glad! i began to wonder if even \n","your luck would see you through! a terrible \n","business, and it nearly was disastrous. but \n","other news can wait. come!\" he said more \n","gravely. \"you are called for;\" and leading the \n","hobbit he took him within the tent. \n","\n","\"hail! thorin,\" he said as he entered. \"i have \n","brought him.\" \n","\n","there indeed lay thorin oakenshield, \n","wounded with many wounds, and his rent \n","armour and notched axe were cast upon the \n","floor. he looked up as bilbo came beside him. \n","\n","\"farewell, good thief,\" he said. \"i go now to \n","the halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, until \n","the world is renewed. since i leave now all gold \n","and silver, and go where it is of little worth, i \n","wish to part in friendship from you, and i would \n","take back my words and deeds at the gate.\" \n","\n","bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. \n","\"farewell, king under the mountain!\" he said. \n","\n","\n","\n","\"this is a bitter adventure, if it must end so; and \n","not a mountain of gold can amend it. yet i am \n","glad that i have shared in your perils - that has \n","been more than any baggins deserves.\" \n","\n","\"no!\" said thorin. \"there is more in you of \n","good than you know, child of the kindly west. \n","some courage and some wisdom, blended in \n","measure. if more of us valued food and cheer \n","and song above hoarded gold, it would be a \n","merrier world. but sad or merry, i must leave it \n","now. farewell!\" \n","\n","then bilbo turned away, and he went by \n","himself, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket, \n","and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until \n","his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse. \n","he was a kindly little soul. indeed it was long \n","before he had the heart to make a joke again. \n","\"a mercy it is,\" he said at last to himself, \"that i \n","woke up when i did. i wish thorin were living, \n","but i am glad that we parted in kindness. you \n","are a fool, bilbo baggins, and you made a \n","great mess of that business with the stone; and \n","there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to \n","buy peace and quiet, but i suppose you can \n","hardly be blamed for that.\" \n","\n","\n","all that had happened after he was stunned, \n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow \n","than joy, and he was now weary of his \n","adventure. he was aching in his bones for the \n","homeward journey that, however, was a little \n","delayed, so in the meantime i will tell something \n","of events. the eagles had long had suspicion \n","of the goblins' mustering; from their \n","watchfulness the movements in the mountains \n","could not be altogether hid. so they too had \n","gathered in great numbers, under the great \n","eagle of the misty mountains; and at length \n","smelling battle from afar they had come \n","speeding down the gale in the nick of time. \n","they it was who dislodged the goblins from the \n","mountain-slopes, casting them over precipices, \n","or driving them down shrieking and bewildered \n","among their foes. it was not long before they \n","had freed the lonely mountain, and elves and \n","men on either side of the valley could come at \n","last to the help of the battle below. \n","\n","but even with the eagles they were still \n","outnumbered. in that last hour beorn himself \n","had appeared - no one knew how or from \n","where. he came alone, and in bear's shape; \n","and he seemed to have grown almost to giant- \n","size in his wrath. \n","\n","the roar of his voice was like drums and \n","guns; and he tossed wolves and goblins from \n","his path like straws and feathers. he fell upon \n","\n","\n","\n","their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder \n","through the ring. the dwarves were making a \n","stand still about their lords upon a low rounded \n","hill. then beorn stooped and lifted thorin, who \n","had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him \n","out of the fray. \n","\n","swiftly he returned and his wrath was \n","redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him, \n","and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. he \n","scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down bolg \n","himself and crushed him. then dismay fell on \n","the goblins and they fled in all directions. but \n","weariness left their enemies with the coming of \n","new hope, and they pursued them closely, and \n","prevented most of them from escaping where \n","they could. they drove many of them into the \n","running river, and such as fled south or west \n","they hunted into the marshes about the forest \n","river; and there the greater part of the last \n","fugitives perished, while those that came hardly \n","to the wood-elves' realm were there slain, or \n","drawn in to die deep in the trackless dark of \n","mirkwood. songs have said that three parts of \n","the goblin warriors of the north perished on that \n","day, and the mountains had peace for many a \n","year. \n","\n","victory had been assured before the fall of \n","night; but the pursuit was still on foot, when \n","bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were \n","\n","\n","\n","in the valley save the more grievously wounded. \n","\n","\"where are the eagles?\" he asked gandalf \n","that evening, as he lay wrapped in many warm \n","blankets. \n","\n","\"some are in the hunt,\" said the wizard, \"but \n","most have gone back to their eyries. they \n","would not stay here, and departed with the first \n","light of morning. dain has crowned their chief \n","with gold, and sworn friendship with them \n","forever.\" \n","\n","\"i am sorry. i mean, i should have liked to \n","see them again,\" said bilbo sleepily; \"perhaps i \n","shall see them on the way home. i suppose i \n","shall be going home soon?\" \n","\n","\"as soon as you like,\" said the wizard. \n","\n","actually it was some days before bilbo \n","really set out. they buried thorin deep beneath \n","the mountain, and bard laid the arkenstone \n","upon his breast. \n","\n","\"there let it lie till the mountain falls!\" he \n","said. \"may it bring good fortune to all his folk \n","that dwell here after!\" \n","\n","upon his tomb the elvenking then laid \n","orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken \n","from thorin in captivity. it is said in songs that it \n","gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, \n","and the fortress of the dwarves could not be \n","taken by surprise. there now dain son of nain \n","took up his abode, and he became king under \n","\n","\n","\n","the mountain, and in time many other dwarves \n","gathered to his throne in the ancient halls. of \n","the twelve companions of thorin, ten remained. \n","fili and kili had fallen defending him with shield \n","and body, for he was their mother's elder \n","brother. the others remained with dain; for \n","dain dealt his treasure well. \n","\n","there was, of course, no longer any \n","question of dividing the hoard in such shares as \n","had been planned, to balin and dwalin, and \n","dori and nori and ori, and oin and gloin, and \n","bifur and bofur and bombur - or to bilbo. yet a \n","fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, \n","wrought and unwrought, was given up to bard; \n","for dain said: \"we will honour the agreement of \n","the dead, and he has now the arkenstone in his \n","keeping.\" \n","\n","even a fourteenth share was wealth \n","exceedingly great, greater than that of many \n","mortal kings. from that treasure bard sent \n","much gold to the master of lake-town; and he \n","rewarded his followers and friends freely. to the \n","elvenking he gave the emeralds of girion, such \n","jewels as he most loved, which dain had \n","restored to him. \n","\n","to bilbo he said: \"this treasure is as much \n","yours as it is mine; though old agreements \n","cannot stand, since so many have a claim in its \n","winning and defence. yet even though you were \n","\n","\n","\n","willing to lay aside all your claim, i should wish \n","that the words of thorin, of which he repented, \n","should not prove true: that we should give you \n","little. i would reward you most richly of all.\" \n","\n","\"very kind of you,\" said bilbo. \"but really it \n","is a relief to me. how on earth should i have got \n","all that treasure home without war and murder \n","all along the way, i don't know. and i don't know \n","what i should have done with it when i got home. \n","i am sure it is better in your hands.\" \n","\n","in the end he would only take two small \n","chests, one filled with silver, and the other with \n","gold, such as one strong pony could carry. \"that \n","will be quite as much as i can manage,\" said \n","he. \n","\n","at last the time came for him to say good- \n","bye to his friends. \"farewell, balin!\" he said; \n","\"and farewell, dwalin; and farewell dori, nori, \n","ori, oin, gloin, bifur, bofur, and bombur! may \n","your beards never grow thin!\" and turning \n","towards the mountain he added: \"farewell \n","thorin oakenshield! and fili and kili! may your \n","memory never fade!\" \n","\n","then the dwarves bowed low before their \n","gate, but words stuck in their throats. \"good- \n","bye and good luck, wherever you fare!\" said \n","balin at last. \"if ever you visit us again, when our \n","halls are made fair once more, then the feast \n","shall indeed be splendid!\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\"if ever you are passing my way,\" said \n","bilbo, \"don't wait to knock! tea is at four; but \n","any of you are welcome at anytime!\" \n","\n","then he turned away. \n","\n","\n","the elf-host was on the march; and if it was \n","sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the \n","northern world would be merrier for many a long \n","day. the dragon was dead, and the goblins \n","overthrown, and their hearts looked forward \n","after winter to a spring of joy. \n","\n","gandalf and bilbo rode behind the \n","elvenking, and beside them strode beorn, once \n","again in man's shape, and he laughed and \n","sang in a loud voice upon the road. so they \n","went on until they drew near to the borders of \n","mirkwood, to the north of the place where the \n","forest river ran out. then they halted, for the \n","wizard and bilbo would not enter the wood, \n","even though the king bade them stay a while in \n","his halls. they intended to go along the edge of \n","the forest, and round its northern end in the \n","waste that lay between it and the beginning of \n","the grey mountains. it was a long and cheerless \n","road, but now that the goblins were crushed, it \n","seemed safer to them than the dreadful \n","pathways under the trees. moreover beorn was \n","\n","\n","\n","going that way too. \n","\n","\"farewell! o elvenking!\" said gandalf. \n","\"merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet \n","young! and merry be all your folk!\" \n","\n","\"farewell! o gandalf!\" said the king. \"may \n","you ever appear where you are most needed \n","and least expected! the oftener you appear in \n","my halls the better shall i be pleased!\" \n","\n","\"i beg of you,\" said bilbo stammering and \n","standing on one foot, \"to accept this gift!\" and \n","he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls \n","that dain had given him at their parting. \n","\n","\"in what way have i earned such a gift, o \n","hobbit?\" said the king. \n","\n","\"well, er, i thought, don't you know,\" said \n","bilbo rather confused, \"that, er, some little return \n","should be made for your, er, hospitality. i mean \n","even a burglar has his feelings. i have drunk \n","much of your wine and eaten much of your \n","bread.\" \n","\n","\"i will take your gift, o bilbo the \n","magnificent!\" said the king gravely. \"and i name \n","you elf-friend and blessed. may your shadow \n","never grow less (or stealing would be too easy)! \n","farewell!\" \n","\n","then the elves turned towards the forest, \n","and bilbo started on his long road home. \n","\n","\n","\n","he had many hardships and adventures before \n","he got back. the wild was still the wild, and \n","there were many other things in it in those days \n","beside goblins; but he was well guided and well \n","guarded - the wizard was with him, and beorn \n","for much of the way - and he was never in great \n","danger again. anyway by midwinter gandalf \n","and bilbo had come all the way back, along \n","both edges of the forest, to the doors of \n","beorn's house; and there for a while they both \n","stayed. yule-tide was warm and merry there; \n","and men came from far and wide to feast at \n","beorn's bidding. the goblins of the misty \n","mountains were now few and terrified, and \n","hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and \n","the wargs had vanished from the woods, so \n","that men went abroad without fear. beorn \n","indeed became a great chief afterwards in \n","those regions and ruled a wide land between \n","the mountains and the wood; and it is said that \n","for many generations the men of his line had the \n","power of taking bear's shape, and some were \n","grim men and bad, but most were in heart like \n","beorn, if less in size and strength. in their day \n","the last goblins were hunted from the misty \n","mountains and a new peace came over the \n","edge of the wild. \n","\n","it was spring, and a fair one with mild \n","\n","\n","\n","weathers and a bright sun, before bilbo and \n","gandalf took their leave at last of beorn, and \n","though he longed for home, bilbo left with \n","regret, for the flowers of the gardens of beorn \n","were in springtime no less marvellous than in \n","high summer. \n","\n","at last they came up the long road, and \n","reached the very pass where the goblins had \n","captured them before. but they came to that \n","high point at morning, and looking backward \n","they saw a white sun shining over the \n","outstretched lands. there behind lay mirkwood, \n","blue in the distance, and darkly green at the \n","nearer edge even in the spring. there far away \n","was the lonely mountain on the edge of \n","eyesight. on its highest peak snow yet \n","unmelted was gleaming pale. \n","\n","\"so comes snow after fire, and even \n","dragons have their ending!\" said bilbo, and he \n","turned his back on his adventure. the tookish \n","part was getting very tired, and the baggins \n","was daily getting stronger. \"i wish now only to \n","be in my own armchair!\" he said. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter x ix \n","\n","\n","the last stage \n","\n","\n","it was on may the first that the two came back \n","at last to the brink of the valley of rivendell, \n","where stood the last (or the first) homely \n","house. again it was evening, their ponies were \n","tired, especially the one that carried the \n","baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. as \n","they rode down the steep path, bilbo heard the \n","elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not \n","stopped since he left; and as soon as the riders \n","came down into the lower glades of the wood \n","they burst into a song of much the same kind as \n","before. this is something like it: \n","\n","\n","the dragon is withered, \n","\n","his bones are nowcrumbled; \n","his armour is shivered, \n","\n","his splendour is humbled! \n","though svnrd shall be rusted, \n","and throne and crown perish \n","with strength that men trusted \n","and wealth that they cherish, \n","here grass is still growing, \n","and leaves are yet swinging, \n","the white water flowing, \n","\n","and elves are yet singing \n","\n","come! tra-la-la-lally! \n","\n","come back to the valley! \n","\n","\n","the stars are far brighter \n","than gems without measure, \n","the moon is far whiter \n","than silver in treasure; \n","\n","the fire is more shining \n","on hearth in the gloaming \n","than gold won by mining, \n","\n","so why go a-roaming? \n","\n","o! tra-la-la-lally \n","\n","come back to the valley. \n","\n","\n","o! where are you going, \n","\n","so late in returning? \n","\n","the river is flowing, \n","\n","the stars are all burning! \n","o! whither so laden, \n","\n","so sad and so dreary? \n","here elf and elf-maiden \n","nowwelcome the weary \n","with tra-la-la-lally \n","come back to the valley, \n","tra-la-la-lally \n","fa-1 a-la-l ally \n","fa-la! \n","\n","\n","then the elves of the valley came out and \n","greeted them and led them across the water to \n","the house of elrond. there a warm welcome \n","was made them, and there were many eager \n","ears that evening to hear the tale of their \n","adventures. gandalf it was who spoke, for bilbo \n","was fallen quiet and drowsy. most of the tale he \n","knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told \n","much of it to the wizard on their homeward way \n","or in the house of beorn; but every now and \n","again he would open one eye, and listen, when \n","a part of the story which he did not yet know \n","came in. \n","\n","\n","\n","it was in this way that he learned where \n","gandalf had been to; for he overheard the \n","words of the wizard to elrond. it appeared that \n","gandalf had been to a great council of the white \n","wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and \n","that they had at last driven the necromancer \n","from his dark hold in the south of mirkwood. \n","\n","\"ere long now,\" gandalf was saying, \"the \n","forest will grow somewhat more wholesome. \n","the north will be freed from that horror for many \n","long years, i hope. yet i wish he were banished \n","from the world!\" \n","\n","\"it would be well indeed,\" said elrond; \"but i \n","fear that will not come about in this age of the \n","world, or for many after.\" \n","\n","when the tale of their journeyings was told, \n","there were other tales, and yet more tales, tales \n","of long ago, and tales of new things, and tales \n","of no time at all, till bilbo's head fell forward on \n","his chest, and he snored comfortably in a \n","corner. \n","\n","he woke to find himself in a white bed, and \n","the moon shining through an open window. \n","below it many elves were singing loud and \n","clear on the banks of the stream. \n","\n","\n","sing all ye joyful, nowsing all together! \n","the t fund's in the tree-top, the wind's in the \n","heather; \n","\n","the stars are in blossom, the moon is in \n","flower, \n","\n","and bright are the windows of night in her \n","tower. \n","\n","\n","dance all ye joyful, now dance all \n","together! \n","\n","soft is the grass, and let foot be like \n","feather! \n","\n","the river is silver, the shadows are \n","fleeting; \n","\n","\n","\n","merry is may-time, and merry our \n","meeting. \n","\n","\n","sing we now softly, and dreams let us \n","v\\eave him! \n","\n","wind him in slumber and there let us \n","leave him! \n","\n","the wanderer sleepeth. now soft be his \n","pillow/. \n","\n","lullaby! lullaby! alder and willow/ \n","\n","\n","sigh no more pine, till the wind of the \n","mom! \n","\n","fall moon! dark be the land! \n","\n","hush! hush! oak, ash, and thom! \n","hushed be all water, till dawn is at hand! \n","\n","\n","\"well, merry people!\" said bilbo looking \n","out. \"what time by the moon is this? your lullaby \n","would waken a drunken goblin! yet i thank you.\" \n","\n","\"and your snores would waken a stone \n","dragon - yet we thank you,\" they answered with \n","laughter. \"it is drawing towards dawn, and you \n","have slept now since the night's beginning. \n","tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of \n","weariness.\" \n","\n","\"a little sleep does a great cure in the \n","house of elrond,\" said he; \"but i will take all the \n","cure i can get. a second good night, fair \n","friends!\" and with that he went back to bed and \n","slept till late morning. \n","\n","weariness fell from him soon in that house, \n","and he had many a merry jest and dance, early \n","and late, with the elves of the valley. yet even \n","that place could not long delay him now, and he \n","thought always of his own home. after a week, \n","\n","\n","\n","therefore, he said farewell to elrond, and giving \n","him such small gifts as he would accept, he \n","rode away with gandalf. \n","\n","even as they left the valley the sky darkened \n","in the west before them, and wind and rain \n","came up to meet them. \n","\n","\"merry is may-time!\" said bilbo, as the rain \n","beat into his face. \"but our back is to legends \n","and we are coming home. i suppose this is the \n","first taste of it.\" \n","\n","\"there is a long road yet,\" said gandalf. \n","\n","\"but it is the last road,\" said bilbo. \n","\n","they came to the river that marked the very \n","edge of the borderland of the wild, and to the \n","ford beneath the steep bank, which you may \n","remember. the water was swollen both with the \n","melting of the snows at the approach of \n","summer, and with the daylong rain; but they \n","crossed with some difficulty, and pressed \n","forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of \n","their journey. \n","\n","this was much as it had been before, \n","except that the company was smaller, and more \n","silent; also this time there were no trolls. at \n","each point on the road bilbo recalled the \n","happenings and the words of a year ago - it \n","seemed to him more like ten - so that, of \n","course, he quickly noted the place where the \n","pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned \n","aside for their nasty adventure with tom and \n","bert and bill. \n","\n","not far from the road they found the gold of \n","the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and \n","untouched. \"i have enough to last me my time,\" \n","said bilbo, when they had dug it up. \"you had \n","better take this, gandalf. i daresay you can find \n","a use for it.\" \n","\n","\"indeed i can!\" said the wizard. \"but share \n","and share alike! you may find you have more \n","needs than you expect.\" \n","\n","so they put the gold in bags and slung them \n","on the ponies, who were not at all pleased \n","\n","\n","\n","about it. after that their going was slower, for \n","most of the time they walked. but the land was \n","green and there was much grass through which \n","the hobbit strolled along contentedly. he \n","mopped his face with a red silk handkerchief - \n","no! not a single one of his own had survived, he \n","had borrowed this one from elrond - for now \n","june had brought summer, and the weather \n","was bright and hot again. \n","\n","as all things come to an end, even this \n","story, a day came at last when they were in \n","sight of the country where bilbo had been born \n","and bred, where the shapes of the land and of \n","the trees were as well known to him as his \n","hands and toes. coming to a rise he could see \n","his own hill in the distance, and he stopped \n","suddenly and said: \n","\n","\n","roads go ever ever on, \n","\n","over rock and under tree, \n","\n","by caves wh ere never sun has shone, \n","\n","by streams that never find the sea; \n","over snow by winter sown, \n","\n","and through the merry flowers of june, \n","overgrass and over stone, \n","\n","and under mountains in the moon. \n","\n","\n","roads go ever ever on \n","\n","under cloud and under star, \n","\n","yet feet that wandering have gone \n","turn at last to home afar. \n","\n","eyes that fire and s/ord have seen \n","and horror in the halls of stone \n","look at last on meadows green \n","\n","and trees and hills they long have \n","known. \n","\n","\n","\n","gandalf looked at him. \"my dear bilbo!\" he \n","said. \"something is the matter with you! you are \n","not the hobbit that you were.\" \n","\n","and so they crossed the bridge and passed \n","the mill by the river and came right back to \n","bilbo's own door. \n","\n","\"bless me! what's going on?\" he cried. \n","there was a great commotion, and people of all \n","sorts, respectable and unrespectable, were \n","thick round the door, and many were going in \n","and out - not even wiping their feet on the mat, \n","as bilbo noticed with annoyance. \n","\n","if he was surprised, they were more \n","surprised still. he had arrived back in the \n","middle of an auction! there was a large notice \n","in black and red hung on the gate, stating that \n","on june the twenty-second messrs grubb, \n","grubb, and burrowes would sell by auction the \n","effects of the late bilbo baggins esquire, of \n","bag-end, underhill, hobbiton. sale to \n","commence at ten o'clock sharp. it was now \n","nearly lunchtime, and most of the things had \n","already been sold, for various prices from next \n","to nothing to old songs (as is not unusual at \n","auctions). bilbo's cousins the sackville- \n","bagginses were, in fact, busy measuring his \n","rooms to see if their own furniture would fit. in \n","short bilbo was \"presumed dead\", and not \n","everybody that said so was sorry to find the \n","presumption wrong. \n","\n","the return of mr. bilbo baggins created \n","quite a disturbance, both under the hill and over \n","the hill, and across the water; it was a great \n","deal more than a nine days' wonder. the legal \n","bother, indeed, lasted for years. it was quite a \n","long time before mr. baggins was in fact \n","admitted to be alive again. the people who had \n","got specially good bargains at the sale took a \n","deal of convincing; and in the end to save time \n","bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own \n","furniture. many of his silver spoons mysteriously \n","disappeared and were never accounted for. \n","\n","\n","\n","personally he suspected the sackville- \n","bagginses. on their side they never admitted \n","that the returned baggins was genuine, and \n","they were not on friendly terms with bilbo ever \n","after. they really had wanted to live in his nice \n","hobbit-hole so very much. \n","\n","indeed bilbo found he had lost more than \n","spoons - he had lost his reputation. it is true \n","that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and \n","had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all \n","such folk as ever passed that way; but he was \n","no longer quite respectable. he was in fact held \n","by all the hobbits of the neighbourhood to be \n","'queer' - except by his nephews and nieces on \n","the took side, but even they were not \n","encouraged in their friendship by their elders. \n","\n","i am sorry to say he did not mind. he was \n","quite content; and the sound of the kettle on his \n","hearth was ever after more musical than it had \n","been even in the quiet days before the \n","unexpected party. his sword he hung over the \n","mantelpiece. his coat of mail was arranged on \n","a stand in the hall (until he lent it to a museum). \n","his gold and silver was largely spent in \n","presents, both useful and extravagant - which to \n","a certain extent accounts for the affection of his \n","nephews and his nieces. his magic ring he \n","kept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when \n","unpleasant callers came. \n","\n","he took to writing poetry and visiting the \n","elves; and though many shook their heads and \n","touched their foreheads and said \"poor old \n","baggins!\" and though few believed any of his \n","tales, he remained very happy to the end of his \n","days, and those were extraordinarily long. \n","\n","\n","one autumn evening some years afterwards \n","bilbo was sitting in his study writing his \n","memoirs - he thought of calling them \"there \n","and back again, a hobbit's holiday\" - when \n","\n","\n","\n","there was a ring at the door. it was gandalf and \n","a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually balin. \n","\n","\"come in! come in!\" said bilbo, and soon \n","they were settled in chairs by the fire. if balin \n","noticed that mr. baggins' waistcoat was more \n","extensive (and had real gold buttons), bilbo \n","also noticed that balin's beard was several \n","inches longer, and his jewelled belt was of great \n","magnificence. \n","\n","they fell to talking of their times together, of \n","course, and bilbo asked how things were going \n","in the lands of the mountain. it seemed they \n","were going very well. bard had rebuilt the town \n","in dale and men had gathered to him from the \n","lake and from south and west, and all the \n","valley had become tilled again and rich, and the \n","desolation was now filled with birds and \n","blossoms in spring and fruit and feasting in \n","autumn. and lake-town was refounded and \n","was more prosperous than ever, and much \n","wealth went up and down the running river; \n","and there was friendship in those parts \n","between elves and dwarves and men. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the hall at bag-end residence of b. \n","baggins esquire \n","\n","\n","the old master had come to a bad end. \n","bard had given him much gold for the help of \n","the lake-people, but being of the kind that \n","easily catches such disease he fell under the \n","dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and \n","fled with it, and died of starvation in the waste, \n","\n","\n","\n","deserted by his companions. \n","\n","\"the new master is of wiser kind,\" said \n","balin, \"and very popular, for, of course, he gets \n","most of the credit for the present prosperity. \n","they are making songs which say that in his \n","day the rivers run with gold.\" \n","\n","\"then the prophecies of the old songs have \n","turned out to be true, after a fashion!\" said \n","bilbo. \n","\n","\"of course!\" said gandalf. \"and why should \n","not they prove true? surely you don't disbelieve \n","the prophecies, because you had a hand in \n","bringing them about yourself? you don't really \n","suppose, do you, that all your adventures and \n","escapes were managed by mere luck, just for \n","your sole benefit? you are a very fine person, \n","mr. baggins, and i am very fond of you; but you \n","are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after \n","all!\" \n","\n","\"thank goodness!\" said bilbo laughing, and \n","handed him the tobacco-jar. \n","\n","* book i * \n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 1 . a long-expected party \n","\n","when mr. bilbo baggins of bag end announced that he would shortly be \n","celebrating his eleventy -first birthday with a party of special \n","magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in hobbiton. \n","\n","bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the \n","shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and \n","unexpected return. the riches he had brought back from his travels had now \n","become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk \n","might say, that the hill at bag end was full of tunnels stuffed with \n","treasure. and if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged \n","vigour to marvel at. time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on \n","mr. baggins. at ninety he was much the same as at fifty. at ninety-nine they \n","began to call him we//-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer the \n","mark. there were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much \n","of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) \n","perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. \n","\n","'it will have to be paid for,' they said. 'it isn't natural, and \n","trouble will come of it!' \n","\n","but so far trouble had not come; and as mr. baggins was generous with \n","his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good \n","fortune. he remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of \n","course, the sackville-bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among \n","the \n","\n","hobbits of poor and unimportant families. but he had no close friends, until \n","some of his younger cousins began to grow up. \n","\n","the eldest of these, and bilbo's favourite, was young frodo baggins. \n","when bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted frodo as his heir, and brought him to \n","live at bag end; and the hopes of the sackville-bagginses were finally \n","dashed. bilbo and frodo happened to have the same birthday, september \n","22nd. \n","\n","'you had better come and live here, frodo my lad,' said bilbo one day; 'and \n","then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.' at that \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","time frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible \n","twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three. \n","\n","twelve more years passed. each year the bagginses had given very lively \n","combined birthday-parties at bag end; but now it was understood that \n","something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. bilbo was \n","going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number and a very \n","respectable age for a hobbit (the old took himself had only reached 130); \n","and frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33) an important number: the date of \n","his 'coming of age'. \n","\n","tongues began to wag in flobbiton and by water; and rumour of the coming \n","event travelled all over the shire. the history and character of mr. bilbo \n","baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older \n","folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand. \n","\n","no one had a more attentive audience than old ham gamgee, commonly \n","known as the gaffer. he held forth at the ivy bush , a small inn on the \n","bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden \n","at bag end for forty years, and had helped old holman in the same job before \n","that. now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job \n","was mainly carried on by his youngest son, sam gamgee. both father and son \n","were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo. they lived on the hill \n","itself, in number 3 bagshot row just below bag end. \n","\n","'a very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is mr. bilbo, as i've always \n","said,' the gaffer declared. with perfect truth: for bilbo was very polite to \n","him, calling him 'master hamfast', and consulting him constantly upon the \n","growing of vegetables - in the matter of 'roots', especially potatoes, the \n","gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood \n","(including himself). \n","\n","'but what about this frodo that lives with him?' asked old noakes of \n","by water. 'baggins is his name, but he's more than half a brandybuck, they \n","say. it beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should go looking for a wife \n","away there in buckland, where folks are so queer.' \n","\n","'and no wonder they're queer,' put in daddy twofoot (the gaffer's \n","next-door neighbour), 'if they live on the wrong side of the brandywine \n","river, and right agin the old forest. that's a dark bad place, if half the \n","tales be true.' \n","\n","'you're right, dad!' said the gaffer. 'not that the brandybucks of \n","buck-land live in the old forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. they \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","fool about with boats on that big river - and that isn't natural. small \n","wonder that trouble came of it, i say. but be that as it may, mr. frodo is \n","as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. very much like mr. bilbo, \n","and in more than looks. after all his father was a baggins. a decent \n","respectable hobbit was mr. drogo baggins; there was never much to tell of \n","him, till he was drownded.' \n","\n","'drownded?' said several voices. they had heard this and other darker \n","rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, \n","and they were ready to hear it again. 'well, so they say,' said the gaffer. \n","\n","'you see: mr. drogo, he married poor miss primula brandybuck. she was \n","our \n","\n","mr. bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest \n","of the old took's daughters); and mr. drogo was his second cousin. so mr. \n","frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying \n","is, if you follow me. and mr. drogo was staying at brandy flail with his \n","father-in-law, old master gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him \n","being partial to his vittles, and old gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous \n","table); and he went out boating on the brandywine river; and he and his wife \n","were drownded, and poor mr. frodo only a child and all. ' \n","\n","'i've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said \n","old noakes; 'and it was drogo's weight as sunk the boat.' \n","\n","'and / heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,' said \n","sandy man, the hobbiton miller. \n","\n","'you shouldn't listen to all you hear, sandyman,' said the gaffer, who \n","did not much like the miller. 'there isn't no call to go talking of pushing \n","and pulling. boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without \n","looking further for the cause of trouble. anyway: there was this mr. frodo \n","left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer \n","bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in brandy hall. a regular warren, by \n","all accounts. old master gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred \n","relations in the place. mr. bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he \n","brought the lad back to live among decent folk. \n","\n","'but i reckon it was a nasty shock for those sackville-bagginses. they \n","thought they were going to get bag end, that time when he went off and was \n","thought to be dead. and then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes \n","on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! and suddenly \n","he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","sackville-bagginses won't never see the inside of bag end now, or it is to \n","be hoped not.' \n","\n","'there's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, i hear tell,' said a \n","stranger, a visitor on business from michel delving in the westfarthing. \n","\n","'all the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and \n","silver, and jools, by what i've heard. ' \n","\n","'then you've heard more than i can speak to,' answered the gaffer. i \n","know nothing about jools. mr. bilbo is free with his money, and there seems \n","no lack of it; but i know of no tunnel -making. i saw mr. bilbo when he came \n","back, a matter of sixty years ago, when i was a lad. i'd not long come \n","prentice to old holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at bag \n","end helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the \n","garden while the sale was on. and in the middle of it all mr. bilbo comes up \n","the hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. i \n","don't doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign \n","parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn't enough \n","to fill tunnels. but my lad sam will know more about that. he's in and out \n","of bag end. crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all \n","mr. bilbo's tales. mr. bilbo has learned him his letters - meaning no harm, \n","mark you, and i hope no harm will come of it. \n","\n","'elves and dragons' isays to him. 'cabbages and potatoes are better \n","for me and you. don 't go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, \n","or you'll land in trouble too big for you, ' i says to him. and i might say \n","it to others,' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller. \n","\n","but the gaffer did not convince his audience. the legend of bilbo's \n","wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of \n","hobbits. \n","\n","'ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,' \n","argued the miller, voicing common opinion. 'he's often away from home. and \n","look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and \n","that old wandering conjuror, gandalf, and all. you can say what you like, \n","gaffer, but bag end's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.' \n","\n","'and you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you \n","do of boating, mr. sandyman,' retorted the gaffer, disliking the miller even \n","more than usual. if that's being queer, then we could do with a bit more \n","queerness in these parts. there's some not far away that wouldn't offer a \n","pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. but \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","they do things proper at bag end. our sam says that everyone's going to be \n","invited to the party, and there's going to be presents, mark you, presents \n","for all - this very month as is.' \n","\n","that very month was september, and as fine as you could ask. a day or \n","two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable sam) was spread \n","about that there were going to be fireworks - fireworks, what is more, such \n","as had not been seen in the shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since \n","the old took died. \n","\n","days passed and the day drew nearer. an odd-looking waggon laden with \n","odd-looking packages rolled into hobbiton one evening and toiled up the hill \n","to bag end. the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. \n","\n","it was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long \n","beards and deep hoods. a few of them remained at bag end. at the end of the \n","second week in september a cart came in through bywater from the direction \n","of the brandywine bridge in broad daylight. an old man was driving it all \n","alone. he wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver \n","scarf. he had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond \n","the brim of his hat. small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through \n","hobbiton and right up the hill. it had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly \n","guessed. at bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great \n","bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red \n","g and the elf-rune, . \n","\n","that was gandalf s mark, of course, and the old man was gandalf the \n","wizard, whose fame in the shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, \n","smokes, and lights. his real business was far more difficult and dangerous, \n","but the shire-folk knew nothing about it. to them he was just one of the \n","'attractions' at the party. hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. 'g \n","for grand!' they shouted, and the old man smiled. they knew him by sight, \n","though he only appeared in hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but \n","neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his \n","firework displays - they now belonged to the legendary past. \n","\n","when the old man, helped by bilbo and some dwarves, had finished \n","unloading. bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker \n","was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers. \n","\n","'run away now!' said gandalf. 'you will get plenty when the time \n","comes.' then he disappeared inside with bilbo, and the door was shut. the \n","young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","feeling that the day of the party would never come. \n","\n","inside bag end, bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the open window of a \n","small room looking out west on to the garden. the late afternoon was bright \n","and peaceful. the flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and \n","sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in \n","at the round windows. \n","\n","'how bright your garden looks!' said gandalf. \n","\n","'yes,' said bilbo. i am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old \n","shire; but i think i need a holiday.' \n","\n","'you mean to go on with your plan then?' \n","\n","'i do. i made up my mind months ago, and i haven't changed it.' \n","\n","'very well. it is no good saying any more. stick to your plan - your \n","whole plan, mind - and i hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and \n","for all of us.' \n","\n","'i hope so. anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday, and have my \n","little joke.' \n","\n","'who will laugh, i wonder?' said gandalf, shaking his head. \n","\n","'we shall see,' said bilbo. \n","\n","the next day more carts rolled up the hill, and still more carts. there \n","might have been some grumbling about 'dealing locally', but that very week \n","orders began to pour out of bag end for every kind of provision, commodity, \n","or luxury that could be obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the \n","neighbourhood. people became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the \n","days on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for \n","invitations. \n","\n","before long the invitations began pouring out, and the hobbiton \n","post-office was blocked, and the bywater post-office was snowed under, and \n","voluntary assistant postmen were called for. there was a constant stream of \n","them going up the hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you, \n","\n","i shall certainly come. \n","\n","a notice appeared on the gate at bag end: no admittance except \n","on party \n","\n","business. even those who had, or pretended to have party business were \n","seldom allowed inside. bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off \n","answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his \n","own. from the time of gandalf s arrival he remained hidden from view. \n","\n","one morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of bilbo's \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. a special \n","entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a \n","large white gate were built there. the three hobbit-families of bagshot row, \n","adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied. old \n","gaffer gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden. \n","\n","the tents began to go up. there was a specially large pavilion, so big \n","that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood proudly \n","near one end, at the head of the chief table. lanterns were hung on all its \n","branches. more promising still (to the hobbits' mind): an enormous open-air \n","kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. a draught of cooks, \n","from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the \n","dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at bag end. excitement rose \n","to its height. \n","\n","then the weather clouded over. that was on wednesday the eve of the \n","party. anxiety was intense. then thursday, september the 22nd, actually \n","dawned. the sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun \n","began. \n","\n","bilbo baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of \n","entertainments rolled into one. practically everybody living near was \n","invited. a very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned up all \n","the same, that did not matter. many people from other parts of the shire \n","were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. bilbo \n","met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. ele gave away \n","presents to all and sundry - the latter were those who went out again by a \n","back way and came in again by the gate. hobbits give presents to other \n","people on their own birthdays. not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not \n","so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. actually in \n","hobbiton and bywater every day in the year it was somebody's birthday, so \n","that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present \n","at least once a week. but they never got tired of them. \n","\n","on this occasion the presents were unusually good. the hobbit-children \n","were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. there were \n","toys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some \n","obviously magical. many of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and \n","had come all the way from the mountain and from dale, and were of real \n","dwarf-make. \n","\n","when every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink. \n","there were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). but \n","lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the \n","guests were sitting down and eating together. at other times there were \n","merely lots of people eating and drinking - continuously from elevenses \n","until six-thirty, when the fireworks started. \n","\n","the fireworks were by gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but \n","designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights \n","of rockets were let off by him. but there was also a generous distribution \n","of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, \n","elf-fountains, goblin -barkers and thunder -claps. they were all superb. the \n","art of gandalf improved with age. \n","\n","there were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with \n","sweet voices. there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves \n","opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches \n","dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with \n","a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. there were \n","fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were \n","pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing \n","ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a \n","shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang \n","suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down \n","again into the water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. and there was \n","also one last surprise, in honour of bilbo, and it startled the hobbits \n","exceedingly, as gandalf intended. the lights went out. a great smoke went \n","up. it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow \n","at the summit. it spouted green and scarlet flames. out flew a red -golden \n","dragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his \n","eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the \n","heads of the crowd. they all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. the \n","dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over \n","bywater with a deafening explosion. \n","\n","that is the signal for supper!' said bilbo. the pain and alarm \n","vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. there was \n","a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited \n","to the special family dinner-party. this was held in the great pavilion with \n","the tree. the invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","by the hobbits one gross, though the word was not considered proper to use \n","of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which \n","bilbo and frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated \n","friends (such as gandalf). many young hobbits were included, and present by \n","parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the \n","matter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting \n","them a free meal. bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender. \n","\n","there were many bagginses and boffins, and also many tooks and \n","brandybucks; there were various grubbs (relations of bilbo baggins' \n","grandmother), and various chubbs (connexions of his took grandfather); and \n","selection of burrowses, bolgers, bracegirdles, brockhouses, goodbodies, \n","hornblowers and proudfoots. some of these were only very distantly \n","connected \n","\n","with bilbo, and some of them had hardly ever been in hobbiton before, as \n","they lived in remote corners of the shire. the sackville-bagginses were not \n","forgotten. otho and his wife lobelia were present. they disliked bilbo and \n","detested frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in \n","golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. besides, their \n","cousin, bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years and his table \n","had a high reputation. \n","\n","all the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; \n","though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an \n","inevitable item). fie was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry; \n","and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to the absurd adventures \n","of his mysterious journey. the guests were not disappointed: they had a very \n","pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, \n","and prolonged. the purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout \n","the district in the ensuing weeks; but as bilbo's catering had depleted the \n","stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not \n","matter much. \n","\n","after the feast (more or less) came the speech. most of the company \n","were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they \n","called 'filling up the corners'. they were sipping their favourite drinks, \n","and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. \n","\n","they were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop. \n","\n","my dear people, began bilbo, rising in his place. 'flear! flear! hear!' \n","they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","follow their own advice. bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair \n","under the illuminated tree. the light of the lanterns fell on his beaming \n","face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. they could \n","all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the other was in his \n","trouser -pocket. \n","\n","my dear bagginses and boffins, he began again; and my dear tooks and \n","brandybucks, and grubbs, and chubbs, and burrowses, and hornblowers, \n","and \n","\n","bolgers, bracegirdles, goodbodies, brockhouses and proudfoots. \n","\n","'proudfeet!' \n","\n","shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. his name, of \n","course, was proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally \n","furry, and both were on the table. \n","\n","proudfoots, repeated bilbo. also my good sackville-bagginses that i \n","welcome back at last to bag end. today is my one hundred and eleventh \n","birthday: i am eleventy -one today!' hurray! hurray! many happy returns!' \n","they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables. bilbo was doing \n","splendidly. this was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious. \n","\n","i hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as i am. deafening \n","cheers. cries of yes (and no). noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and \n","flutes, and other musical instruments. there were, as has been said, many \n","young hobbits present. hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. most of \n","them bore the mark dale on them; which did not convey much to most of \n","the \n","\n","hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. they contained \n","instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. indeed, in one \n","corner some of the young tooks and brandybucks, supposing uncle bilbo to \n","have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up \n","an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. master everard took \n","and miss melilot brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands \n","began to dance the springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous. \n","\n","but bilbo had not finished. seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he \n","blew three loud hoots. the noise subsided. / shall not keep you long, he \n","cried. cheers from all the assembly. / have called you all together for a \n","purpose. something in the way that he said this made an impression. there \n","was almost silence, and one or two of the tooks pricked up their ears. \n","\n","indeed, for three purposes! first of all, to tell you that i am \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time \n","to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. tremendous outburst of \n","approval. \n","\n","/ don 't know half of you half as well as i should like; and i like less \n","than half of you half as well as you deserve. this was unexpected and rather \n","difficult. there was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying \n","to work it out and see if it came to a compliment. \n","\n","secondly, to celebrate my birthday. cheers again. i should say: our \n","birthday. for it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, \n","\n","frodo. he comes of age and into his inheritance today. some perfunctory \n","clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of 'frodo! frodo! jolly old \n","frodo,' from the juniors. the sackville-bagginses scowled, and wondered what \n","was meant by 'coming into his inheritance'. together we score one hundred \n","and forty-four. your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total: one \n","gross, if i may use the expression. no cheers. this was ridiculous. many of \n","his guests, and especially the sackville-bagginses, were insulted, feeling \n","sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in \n","a package. 'one gross, indeed! vulgar expression.' \n","\n","it is also, if i may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the \n","anniversary of my arrival by barrel at esgaroth on the long lake; though the \n","fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. i was only \n","fifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. the banquet was \n","very splendid, however, though i had a bad cold at the time, i remember, and \n","could only say 'thagyou very buch'. i now repeat it more correctly: thank \n","you very much for coming to my little party. obstinate silence. they all \n","feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting \n","bored. why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health? but bilbo \n","did not sing or recite. fie paused for a moment. \n","\n","thirdly and finally, he said, i wish to make an announcement. fie \n","spoke \n","\n","this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. \n","\n","i regret to announce that - though, as i said, eleventy-one years is far too \n","short a time to spend among you - this is the end. i am going. i am leaving \n","now. good-bye 7 \n","\n","he stepped down and vanished. there was a blinding flash of light, and \n","the guests all blinked. when they opened their eyes bilbo was nowhere to be \n","seen. one hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","old odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped. then there \n","was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every \n","baggins, boffin, took, brandybuck, grubb, chubb, burrows, bolger, \n","bracegirdle, brockhouse, goodbody, hornblower, and proudfoot began to \n","talk \n","\n","at once. \n","\n","it was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more \n","food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. 'he's \n","mad. i always said so,' was probably the most popular comment. even the \n","tooks (with a few exceptions) thought bilbo's behaviour was absurd. for the \n","moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing \n","more than a ridiculous prank. \n","\n","but old rory brandybuck was not so sure. neither age nor an enormous \n","dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, esmeralda: \n","'there's something fishy in this, my dear! i believe that mad baggins is off \n","again. silly old fool. but why worry? he hasn't taken the vittles with him.' \n","\n","he called loudly to frodo to send the wine round again. \n","\n","frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. for some time he \n","had sat silent beside bilbo's empty chair, and ignored all remarks and \n","questions. he had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in \n","the know. he had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant \n","surprise of the guests. but at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he \n","realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. most of the guests \n","went on eating and drinking and discussing bilbo baggins' oddities, past and \n","present; but the sackville-bagginses had already departed in wrath. frodo \n","did not want to have any more to do with the party. he gave orders for more \n","wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the \n","health of bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion. \n","\n","as for bilbo baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been \n","fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept \n","secret for so many years. as he stepped down he slipped it on his finger, \n","and he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again. \n","\n","he walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening \n","with a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in \n","other parts of the field. then he went in. he took off his party clothes, \n","folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and \n","put it away. then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","round his waist a worn leather belt. on it he hung a short sword in a \n","battered black-leather scabbard. from a locked drawer, smelling of \n","moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. they had been locked up as if \n","they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that \n","their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark \n","green. they were rather too large for him. he then went into his study, and \n","from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a \n","leather -bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. the book and \n","bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there, \n","already nearly full. into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its \n","fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to frodo. at first he put \n","it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his \n","pocket. at that moment the door opened and gandalf came quickly in. \n","\n","'hullo!' said bilbo. 'i wondered if you would turn up.' \n","\n","'i am glad to find you visible,' replied the wizard, sitting down in a \n","chair, 'i wanted to catch you and have a few final words. i suppose you feel \n","that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?' \n","\n","'yes, i do,' said bilbo. \"though that flash was surprising: it quite \n","startled me, let alone the others. a little addition of your own, i \n","suppose?' \n","\n","it was. you have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it \n","seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to \n","explain your sudden vanishment.' \n","\n","'and would spoil my joke. you are an interfering old busybody,' laughed \n","bilbo, 'but i expect you know best, as usual.' \n","\n","'i do - when i know anything. but i don't feel too sure about this \n","whole affair. it has now come to the final point. you have had your joke, \n","and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the whole shire \n","something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. are you \n","going any further?' \n","\n","'yes, i am. i feel i need a holiday, a very long holiday, as i have \n","told you before. probably a permanent holiday: i don't expect i shall \n","return. in fact, i don't mean to, and i have made all arrangements. \n","\n","'i am old, gandalf. i don't look it, but i am beginning to feel it in \n","my heart of hearts. well-preserved indeed!' he snorted. 'why, i feel all \n","thin, sort of stretched, if you know what i mean: like butter that has been \n","scraped over too much bread. that can't be right. i need a change, or \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","something.' \n","\n","gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. 'no, it does not seem \n","right,' he said thoughtfully. 'no, after all i believe your plan is probably \n","the best.' \n","\n","'well, i've made up my mind, anyway. i want to see mountains again, \n","gandalf, mountains, and then find somewhere where i can rest. in peace and \n","quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded \n","visitors hanging on the bell. i might find somewhere where i can finish my \n","book. i have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived happily ever \n","after to the end of his days. ' \n","\n","gandalf laughed. i hope he will. but nobody will read the book, however \n","it ends.' \n","\n","'oh, they may, in years to come. frodo has read some already, as far as \n","it has gone. you'll keep an eye on frodo, won't you?' \n","\n","'yes, i will - two eyes, as often as i can spare them.' \n","\n","'he would come with me, of course, if i asked him. in fact he offered \n","to once, just before the party. but he does not really want to, yet. i want \n","to see the wild country again before i die, and the mountains; but he is \n","still in love with the shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. he \n","ought to be comfortable here. i am leaving everything to him, of course, \n","except a few oddments. i hope he will be happy, when he gets used to being \n","on his own. it's time he was his own master now.' \n","\n","'everything?' said gandalf. 'the ring as well? you agreed to that, you \n","remember.' \n","\n","'well, er, yes, i suppose so,' stammered bilbo. \n","\n","'where is it?' \n","\n","'in an envelope, if you must know,' said bilbo impatiently. 'there on \n","the mantelpiece. well, no! here it is in my pocket!' he hesitated. 'isn't \n","that odd now?' he said softly to himself. 'yet after all, why not? why \n","shouldn't it stay there?' \n","\n","gandalf looked again very hard at bilbo, and there was a gleam in his \n","eyes. 'i think, bilbo,' he said quietly, 'i should leave it behind. don't \n","you want to?' \n","\n","'well yes - and no. now it comes to it, i don't like parting with it at \n","all, i may say. and i don't really see why i should. why do you want me to?' \n","he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. it was sharp with \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","suspicion and annoyance. 'you are always badgering me about my ring; but \n","you \n","\n","have never bothered me about the other things that i got on my journey.' \n","\n","'no, but i had to badger you,' said gandalf. 'i wanted the truth. it \n","was important. magic rings are - well, magical; and they are rare and \n","curious. i was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and i \n","still am. i should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. also \n","i think you have had it quite long enough. you won't need it any more. \n","bilbo, unless i am quite mistaken.' \n","\n","bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. his kindly \n","face grew hard. 'why not?' he cried. 'and what business is it of yours, \n","anyway, to know what i do with my own things? it is my own. i found it. it \n","came to me.' \n","\n","'yes, yes,' said gandalf. 'but there is no need to get angry.' \n","\n","'if i am it is your fault,' said bilbo. 'it is mine, i tell you. my \n","own. my precious. yes, my precious.' \n","\n","the wizard's face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in \n","his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. 'it has been \n","called that before,' he said, 'but not by you.' \n","\n","'but i say it now. and why not? even if gollum said the same once. it's \n","not his now, but mine. and i shall keep it, i say.' \n","\n","gandalf stood up. he spoke sternly. 'you will be a fool if you do. \n","\n","bilbo,' he said. 'you make that clearer with every word you say. it has got \n","far too much hold on you. let it go! and then you can go yourself, and be \n","free.' \n","\n","'i'll do as i choose and go as i please,' said bilbo obstinately. \n","\n","'now, now, my dear hobbit! ' said gandalf. 'all your long life we have \n","been friends, and you owe me something. come! do as you promised: give it \n","up! ' \n","\n","'well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!' cried bilbo. 'but you \n","won't get it. i won't give my precious away, i tell you.' his hand strayed \n","to the hilt of his small sword. \n","\n","gandalf s eyes flashed. it will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said. \n","\n","if you say that again, i shall. then you will see gandalf the grey \n","uncloaked.' he took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall \n","and menacing; his shadow filled the little room. \n","\n","bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","his pocket. they stood for a while facing one another, and the air of the \n","room tingled. gandalf s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. slowly his hands \n","relaxed, and he began to tremble. \n","\n","'i don't know what has come over you, gandalf,' he said. 'you have \n","never been like this before. what is it all about? it is mine isn't it? i \n","found it, and gollum would have killed me, if i hadn't kept it. i'm not a \n","thief, whatever he said.' \n","\n","'i have never called you one,' gandalf answered. 'and i am not one \n","either. i am not trying to rob you, but to help you. i wish you would trust \n","me, as you used.' he turned away, and the shadow passed. he seemed to \n","dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled. \n","\n","bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. i am sorry,' he said. 'but i felt so \n","queer. and yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any \n","more. it has been so growing on my mind lately. sometimes i have felt it was \n","like an eye looking at me. and i am always wanting to put it on and \n","disappear, don't you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to \n","make sure. i tried locking it up, but i found i couldn't rest without it in \n","my pocket. i don't know why. and i don't seem able to make up my mind.' \n","\n","'then trust mine,' said gandalf. 'it is quite made up. go away and \n","leave it behind. stop possessing it. give it to frodo, and i will look after \n","him.' \n","\n","bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. presently he sighed. 'all \n","right,' he said with an effort. i will.' then he shrugged his shoulders, and \n","smiled rather ruefully. 'after all that's what this party business was all \n","about, really: to give away lots of birthday presents, and somehow make it \n","easier to give it away at the same time. it hasn't made it any easier in the \n","end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. it would quite \n","spoil the joke.' \n","\n","'indeed it would take away the only point i ever saw in the affair,' \n","said gandalf. \n","\n","'very well,' said bilbo, 'it goes to frodo with all the rest.' he drew \n","a deep breath. 'and now i really must be starting, or somebody else will \n","catch me. i have said good-bye, and i couldn't bear to do it all over \n","again.' he picked up his bag and moved to the door. \n","\n","'you have still got the ring in your pocket,' said the wizard. 'well, \n","so i have!' cried bilbo. 'and my will and all the other documents too. you \n","had better take it and deliver it for me. that will be safest.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'no, don't give the ring to me,' said gandalf. 'put it on the \n","mantelpiece. it will be safe enough there, till frodo comes. i shall wait \n","for him.' \n","\n","bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the \n","clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. before he \n","could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. \n","\n","a spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit's face again. suddenly it \n","gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. 'well, that's that,' he said. 'now \n","i'm off!' \n","\n","they went out into the hall. bilbo chose his favourite stick from the \n","stand; then he whistled. three dwarves came out of different rooms where \n","they had been busy. \n","\n","'is everything ready?' asked bilbo. 'everything packed and labelled?' \n","\n","'everything,' they answered. \n","\n","'well, let's start then!' he stepped out of the front-door. \n","\n","it was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. he looked \n","up, sniffing the air. 'what fun! what fun to be off again, off on the road \n","with dwarves ! this is what i have really been longing for, for years ! \n","good-bye! ' he said, looking at his old home and bowing to the door. \n","'good-bye, gandalf!' \n","\n","'good-bye, for the present, bilbo. take care of yourself! you are old \n","enough, and perhaps wise enough.' \n","\n","'take care! i don't care. don't you worry about me! i am as happy now \n","as i have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. but the time has come. \n","\n","i am being swept off my feet at last,' he added, and then in a low voice, as \n","if to himself, he sang softly in the dark: \n","\n","the road goes ever on and on \n","\n","down from the door where it began. \n","\n","now far ahead the road has gone, \n","\n","and i must follow, if i can, \n","\n","pursuing it with eager feet, \n","\n","until it joins some larger way \n","\n","where many paths and errands meet. \n","\n","and whither then? i cannot say. \n","\n","he paused, silent for a moment. then without another word he turned \n","away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his \n","three companions went round into his garden, and trotted down the long \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","sloping path. he jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and \n","took to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the \n","grass. \n","\n","gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness. \n","'goodbye, my dear bilbo - until our next meeting!' he said softly and went \n","back indoors. \n","\n","frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep \n","in thought. 'has he gone?' he asked. \n","\n","'yes,' answered gandalf, 'he has gone at last.' \n","\n","' i wish - 1 mean, i hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,' \n","said frodo. 'but i knew in my heart that he really meant to go. he always \n","used to joke about serious things. i wish i had come back sooner, just to \n","see him off.' \n","\n","i think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,' said \n","gandalf. 'don't be too troubled. he'll be all right - now. he left a packet \n","for you. there it is!' \n","\n","frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but \n","did not open it. \n","\n","'you'll find his will and all the other documents in there, i think,' \n","said the wizard. 'you are the master of bag end now. and also, i fancy, \n","you'll find a golden ring.' \n","\n","'the ring!' exclaimed frodo. 'has he left me that? i wonder why. still, \n","it may be useful.' \n","\n","'it may, and it may not,' said gandalf. 'i should not make use of it, \n","if i were you. but keep it secret, and keep it safe! now i am going to bed.' \n","\n","as master of bag end frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to \n","the guests. rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field, \n","but frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the \n","morning. about midnight carriages came for the important folk. one by one \n","they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. gardeners \n","came by arrangement, and removed in wheel-barrows those that had \n","inadvertently remained behind. \n","\n","night slowly passed. the sun rose. the hobbits rose rather later. \n","morning went on. people came and began (by orders) to clear away the \n","pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives and \n","bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and \n","the crumbs and cracker -paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","handkerchiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item). then a number of \n","other people came (without orders): bagginses, and boffins, and bolgers, and \n","tooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. by mid-day, when \n","even the best-fed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at bag \n","end, uninvited but not unexpected. \n","\n","frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and \n","worried. he welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more to say than \n","before. his reply to all inquiries was simply this: 'mr. bilbo baggins has \n","gone away; as far as i know, for good.' some of the visitors he invited to \n","come inside, as bilbo had left 'messages' for them. \n","\n","inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and \n","parcels and small articles of furniture. on every item there was a label \n","tied. there were several labels of this sort: \n","\n","for adelard took, for his very own, from bilbo, on an umbrella. \n","adelard \n","\n","had carried off many unlabelled ones. \n","\n","for dora baggins in memory of a long correspondence, with love \n","from \n","\n","bilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. dora was drogo's sister and the eldest \n","surviving female relative of bilbo and frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had \n","written reams of good advice for more than half a century. \n","\n","for milo burrows, hoping it will be useful, from b.b., on a gold pen \n","and ink-bottle. milo never answered letters. \n","\n","for angelica's use, from uncle bilbo, on a round convex mirror. she \n","was \n","\n","a young baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely. \n","\n","for the collection of hugo bracegirdle, from a contributor, on an \n","(empty) book -case. hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual \n","at returning them. \n","\n","for lobelia sackville-baggins, as a present, on a case of \n","silver \n","\n","spoons. bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, \n","while he was away on his former journey. fobelia knew that quite well. when \n","she arrived later in the day, she took the point at once, but she also took \n","the spoons. \n","\n","this is only a small selection of the assembled presents. bilbo's \n","residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","life. it was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the \n","custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. not, of \n","course, that the birthday-presents were always new, there were one or two \n","old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; \n","but bilbo had usually given new presents, and kept those that he received. \n","the old hole was now being cleared a little. \n","\n","every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out \n","personally by bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. but, of \n","course, most of the things were given where they would be wanted and \n","welcome. the poorer hobbits, and especially those of bagshot row, did very \n","well. old gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen \n","waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. old rory \n","brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of old \n","winyards: a strong red wine from the southfarthing, and now quite mature, as \n","it had been laid down by bilbo's father. rory quite forgave bilbo, and voted \n","him a capital fellow after the first bottle. \n","\n","there was plenty of everything left for frodo. and, of course, all the \n","chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than enough \n","furniture, were left in his possession. there was, however, no sign nor \n","mention of money or jewellery: not a penny -piece or a glass bead was given \n","away. \n","\n","frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. a false rumour that the \n","whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before \n","long the place was packed with people who had no business there, but could \n","not be kept out. fabels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. some \n","people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off \n","with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed \n","unwanted or unwatched. the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and \n","handcarts. \n","\n","in the middle of the commotion the sackville-bagginses arrived. frodo \n","had retired for a while and left his friend merry brandybuck to keep an eye \n","on things. when otho loudly demanded to see frodo, merry bowed politely. \n","\n","'he is indisposed,' he said. 'he is resting.' \n","\n","'hiding, you mean,' said fobelia. 'anyway we want to see him and we \n","mean to see him. just go and tell him so!' \n","\n","merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover \n","their parting gift of spoons. it did not improve their tempers. eventually \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","they were shown into the study. frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of \n","papers in front of him. he looked indisposed - to see sackville-bagginses at \n","any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. but he \n","spoke quite politely. \n","\n","the sackville-bagginses were rather offensive. they began by offering \n","him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and \n","unlabelled things. when frodo replied that only the things specially \n","directed by bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very \n","fishy. \n","\n","'only one thing is clear to me,' said otho, 'and that is that you are \n","doing exceedingly well out of it. i insist on seeing the will.' \n","\n","otho would have been bilbo's heir, but for the adoption of frodo. he \n","read the will carefully and snorted. it was, unfortunately, very clear and \n","correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other \n","things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink). \n","\n","'foiled again!' he said to his wife. 'and after waiting sixty years. \n","\n","spoons? fiddlesticks!' he snapped his fingers under frodo's nose and slumped \n","off. but lobelia was not so easily got rid of. a little later frodo came out \n","of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the \n","place, investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors. he escorted \n","her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but \n","rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. her \n","face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing \n","parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was: \n","\n","'you'll live to regret it, young fellow! why didn't you go too? you \n","don't belong here; you're no baggins - you - you're a brandybuck!' \n","\n","'did you hear that, merry? that was an insult, if you like,' said frodo \n","as he shut the door on her. \n","\n","'it was a compliment,' said merry brandybuck, 'and so, of course, not \n","true.' \n","\n","then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two \n","boffins and a bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the \n","cellars. frodo also had a tussle with young sancho proudfoot (old odo \n","proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, \n","where he thought there was an echo. the legend of bilbo's gold excited both \n","curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not \n","positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one's for the finding \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","-unless the search is interrupted. \n","\n","when he had overcome sancho and pushed him out, frodo collapsed on \n","chair in the hall. it's time to close the shop, merry,' he said. 'lock the \n","door, and don't open it to anyone today, not even if they bring a battering \n","ram.' then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea. \n","\n","he had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. \n","'lobelia again most likely,' he thought. 'she must have thought of something \n","really nasty, and have come back again to say it. it can wait.' \n","\n","he went on with his tea. the knock was repeated, much louder, but he \n","took no notice. suddenly the wizard's head appeared at the window. \n","\n","'if you don't let me in, frodo, i shall blow your door right down your \n","hole and out through the hill,' he said. \n","\n","'my dear gandalf! half a minute!' cried frodo, running out of the room \n","to the door. 'come in! come in! i thought it was lobelia.' \n","\n","'then i forgive you. but i saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap \n","towards bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.' \n","\n","'she had already nearly curdled me. honestly, i nearly tried on bilbo's \n","ring. i longed to disappear.' \n","\n","'don't do that!' said gandalf, sitting down. 'do be careful of that \n","ring, frodo ! in fact, it is partly about that that i have come to say a last \n","word.' \n","\n","'well, what about it?' \n","\n","'what do you know already?' \n","\n","'only what bilbo told me. i have heard his story: how he found it, and \n","how he used it: on his journey, i mean.' \n","\n","'which story, i wonder,' said gandalf. \n","\n","'oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,' said frodo. 'he \n","told me the true story soon after i came to live here. he said you had \n","pestered him till he told you, so i had better know too. \"no secrets between \n","us, frodo,\" he said; \"but they are not to go any further. it's mine \n","anyway.'\" \n","\n","'that's interesting,' said gandalf. 'well, what did you think of it \n","all?' \n","\n","'if you mean, inventing all that about a \"present\", well, i thought the \n","true story much more likely, and i couldn't see the point of altering it at \n","all. it was very unlike bilbo to do so, anyway; and i thought it rather \n","odd.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'so did i. but odd things may happen to people that have such treasures \n","- if they use them. let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. \n","\n","it may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.' \n","\n","'i don't understand,' said frodo. \n","\n","'neither do i,' answered the wizard. 'i have merely begun to wonder \n","about the ring, especially since last night. no need to worry. but if you \n","take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. at least i beg \n","you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. i say \n","again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!' \n","\n","'you are very mysterious! what are you afraid of?' \n","\n","'i am not certain, so i will say no more. i may be able to tell you \n","something when i come back. i am going off at once: so this is good-bye for \n","the present.' he got up. \n","\n","'at once!' cried frodo. 'why, i thought you were staying on for at \n","least a week. i was looking forward to your help.' \n","\n","'i did mean to - but i have had to change my mind. i may be away for a \n","good while; but i'll come and see you again, as soon as i can. expect me \n","when you see me! i shall slip in quietly. i shan't often be visiting the \n","shire openly again. i find that i have become rather unpopular. they say i \n","am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. some people are actually \n","accusing me of spiriting bilbo away, or worse. if you want to know, there is \n","supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.' \n","\n","'some people!' exclaimed frodo. 'you mean otho and lobelia. how \n","abominable! i would give them bag end and everything else, if i could get \n","bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him. i love the shire. \n","but i begin to wish, somehow, that i had gone too. i wonder if i shall ever \n","see him again.' \n","\n","'so do i,' said gandalf. 'and i wonder many other things. good-bye now! \n","take care of yourself! lookout for me, especially at unlikely times ! \n","good-bye!' \n","\n","frodo saw him to the door. he gave a final wave of his hand, and walked \n","off at a surprising pace; but frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually \n","bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. the evening was closing \n","in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. frodo did not \n","see him again for a long time. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 2 . the shadow of the past \n","\n","\n","\n","the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety -nine days. the second \n","disappearance of mr. bilbo baggins was discussed in hobbiton, and indeed all \n","over the shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than \n","that. it became a fireside -story for young hobbits; and eventually mad \n","baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags \n","of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long \n","after all the true events were forgotten. \n","\n","but in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that \n","bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and \n","had run off into the blue. there he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a \n","river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. the blame was \n","mostly laid on gandalf. \n","\n","'if only that dratted wizard will leave young frodo alone, perhaps \n","he'll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,' they said. and to all \n","appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the \n","growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. indeed, he at once began to \n","carry on bilbo's reputation for oddity. he refused to go into mourning; and \n","the next year he gave a party in honour of bilbo's hundred-and-twelfth \n","birthday, which he called hundred-weight feast. but that was short of the \n","mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which \n","it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say. \n","\n","some people were rather shocked; but frodo kept up the custom of giving \n","bilbo's birthday party year after year until they got used to it. he said \n","that he did not think bilbo was dead. when they asked: 'where is he then?' \n","he shrugged his shoulders. \n","\n","he lived alone, as bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, \n","especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the old took) \n","who had as children been fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end. \n","folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these; but his closest friends \n","were peregrin took (usually called pippin), and merry brandybuck (his real \n","name was meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). frodo went tramping \n","all \n","\n","over the shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the \n","amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the hills and woods under the starlight. merry and pippin suspected that he \n","visited the elves at times, as bilbo had done. \n","\n","as time went on, people began to notice that frodo also showed signs of \n","good 'preservation': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and \n","energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. 'some folk have all the luck,' they \n","said; but it was not until frodo approached the usually more sober age of \n","fifty that they began to think it queer. \n","\n","frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master \n","and the mr. baggins of bag end was rather pleasant. for some years he was \n","quite happy and did not worry much about the future. but half unknown to \n","himself the regret that he had not gone with bilbo was steadily growing. he \n","found himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild \n","lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his \n","dreams. he began to say to himself: 'perhaps i shall cross the river myself \n","one day.' to which the other half of his mind always replied: 'not yet.' \n","\n","so it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth \n","birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow \n","significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had \n","suddenly befallen bilbo. frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths \n","seemed too well-trodden. he looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond \n","their edges: maps made in the shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its \n","borders. he took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and \n","merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. often he was seen walking \n","and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in \n","the shire. \n","\n","there were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; \n","and as gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several \n","years, frodo gathered all the news he could. elves, who seldom walked in the \n","shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, \n","passing and not returning; but they were leaving middle-earth and were no \n","longer concerned with its troubles. there were, however, dwarves on the road \n","in unusual numbers. the ancient east -west road ran through the shire to its \n","end at the grey havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their \n","mines in the blue mountains. they were the hobbits' chief source of news \n","from distant parts - if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and \n","hobbits asked no more. but now frodo often met strange dwarves of far \n","countries, seeking refuge in the west. they were troubled, and some spoke in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","whispers of the enemy and of the land of mordor. \n","\n","that name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a \n","shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and \n","disquieting. it seemed that the evil power in mirkwood had been driven out \n","by the white council only to reappear in greater strength in the old \n","strongholds of mordor. the dark tower had been rebuilt, it was said. from \n","there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south \n","there were wars and growing fear. ores were multiplying again in the \n","mountains. trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed \n","with dreadful weapons. and there were murmured hints of creatures more \n","terrible than all these, but they had no name. \n","\n","little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. \n","\n","but even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and \n","those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. the \n","conversation in the green dragon at bywater, one evening in the spring of \n","frodo's fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the \n","shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them. \n","\n","sam gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him \n","was ted sandyman, the miller's son; and there were various other rustic \n","hobbits listening to their talk. \n","\n","'queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,' said sam. \n","\n","'ah,' said ted, 'you do, if you listen. but i can hear fireside-tales \n","and children's stories at home, if i want to.' \n","\n","'no doubt you can,' retorted sam, 'and i daresay there's more truth in \n","some of them than you reckon. who invented the stories anyway? take \n","dragons \n","now.' \n","\n","'no thank 'ee,' said ted, 'i won't. i heard tell of them when i was a \n","youngster, but there's no call to believe in them now. there's only one \n","dragon in by water, and that's green,' he said, getting a general laugh. \n","\n","'all right,' said sam, laughing with the rest. 'but what about these \n","tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? they do say that one bigger \n","than a tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long back.' \n","\n","'who's theyt \n","\n","'my cousin hal for one. he works for mr. boffin at overhill and goes up \n","to the northfarthing for the hunting. he saw one.' \n","\n","'says he did, perhaps. your hal's always saying he's seen things; and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","maybe he sees things that ain't there.' \n","\n","'but this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven \n","yards to a stride, if it was an inch.' \n","\n","'then i bet it wasn't an inch. what he saw was an elm tree, as like as \n","not.' \n","\n","'but this one was walking, i tell you; and there ain't no elm tree on \n","the north moors.' \n","\n","'then hal can't have seen one,' said ted. there was some laughing and \n","clapping: the audience seemed to think that ted had scored a point. \n","\n","'all the same,' said sam, 'you can't deny that others besides our \n","halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire - crossing it, mind you: \n","there are more that are turned back at the borders. the bounders have never \n","been so busy before. \n","\n","'and i've heard tell that elves are moving west. they do say they are \n","going to the harbours, out away beyond the white towers.' sam waved his \n","arm \n","\n","vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the sea, past the \n","old towers beyond the western borders of the shire. but it was an old \n","tradition that away over there stood the grey havens, from which at times \n","elven-ships set sail, never to return. \n","\n","'they are sailing, sailing, sailing over the sea, they are going into \n","the west and leaving us,' said sam, half chanting the words, shaking his \n","head sadly and solemnly. but ted laughed. \n","\n","'well, that isn't anything new, if you believe the old tales. and i \n","don't see what it matters to me or you. let them sail! but i warrant you \n","haven't seen them doing it; nor any one else in the shire.' \n","\n","'well i don't know,' said sam thoughtfully. he believed he had once \n","seen an elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day. of all the \n","legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and \n","half-remembered stories about the elves as the hobbits knew, had always \n","moved him most deeply. 'there are some, even in these parts, as know the \n","fair folk and get news of them,' he said. 'there's mr. baggins now, that i \n","work for. he told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about elves. \n","and old mr. bilbo knew more: many's the talk i had with him when i was a \n","little lad.' \n","\n","'oh, they're both cracked,' said ted. 'leastways old bilbo was cracked, \n","and frodo's cracking. if that's where you get your news from, you'll never \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","want for moonshine. well, friends, i'm off home. your good health!' he \n","drained his mug and went out noisily. \n","\n","sam sat silent and said no more. he had a good deal to think about. for \n","one thing, there was a lot to do up in the bag end garden, and he would have \n","a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. the grass was growing fast. but \n","sam had more on his mind than gardening. after a while he sighed, and got up \n","and went out. \n","\n","it was early april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. the \n","sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night. he \n","walked home under the early stars through hobbiton and up the hill, \n","whistling softly and thoughtfully. \n","\n","it was just at this time that gandalf reappeared after his long \n","absence. for three years after the party he had been away. then he paid \n","frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again. \n","during the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming \n","unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. he \n","would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly \n","interested in small news about frodo's health and doings. \n","\n","then suddenly his visits had ceased. it was over nine years since frodo \n","had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would \n","never return and had given up all interest in hobbits. but that evening, as \n","sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar \n","tap on the study window. \n","\n","frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. they \n","looked hard at one another. \n","\n","'ah well eh?' said gandalf. 'you look the same as ever, frodo!' \n","\n","'so do you,' frodo replied; but secretly he thought that gandalf looked \n","older and more careworn. he pressed him for news of himself and of the wide \n","world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the \n","night. \n","\n","next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with frodo \n","by the open window of the study. a bright fire was on the hearth, but the \n","sun was warm, and the wind was in the south. everything looked fresh, and \n","the new green of spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the \n","trees' fingers. \n","\n","gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when \n","bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchief. his hair was perhaps \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps \n","longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as \n","bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke -rings with the same vigour and \n","delight. \n","\n","he was smoking now in silence, for frodo was sitting still, deep in \n","thought. even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings \n","that gandalf had brought. at last he broke the silence. \n","\n","'last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, \n","\n","gandalf,' he said. 'and then you stopped, because you said that such matters \n","were best left until daylight. don't you think you had better finish now? \n","\n","you say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than i guess. in what \n","way?' \n","\n","'in many ways,' answered the wizard. it is far more powerful than i \n","ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it would utterly \n","overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. it would possess him. \n","\n","'in eregion long ago many elven-rings were made, magic rings as you \n","call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more potent and \n","some less. the lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was \n","full-grown, and to the elven-smiths they were but trifles - yet still to my \n","mind dangerous for mortals. but the great rings, the rings of power, they \n","were perilous. \n","\n","'a mortal, frodo, who keeps one of the great rings, does not die, but \n","he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last \n","every minute is a weariness. and if he often uses the ring to make himself \n","invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks \n","in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the rings. yes, \n","sooner or later - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but \n","neither strength nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power \n","will devour him.' \n","\n","'how terrifying!' said frodo. there was another long silence. the sound \n","of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden. \n","\n","'how long have you known this?' asked frodo at length. 'and how much \n","did bilbo know?' \n","\n","'bilbo knew no more than he told you, i am sure,' said gandalf. 'he \n","would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would \n","be a danger, even though i promised to look after you. he thought the ring \n","was very beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","queer, it was himself. he said that it was \"growing on his mind\", and he was \n","always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to \n","blame. though he had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did \n","not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd \n","way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.' \n","\n","'yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,' said frodo, 'so i have \n","always kept it on its chain.' \n","\n","'very wise,' said gandalf. 'but as for his long life, bilbo never \n","connected it with the ring at all. he took all the credit for that to \n","himself, and he was very proud of it. though he was getting restless and \n","uneasy. thin and stretched he said. a sign that the ring was getting \n","control.' \n","\n","'how long have you known all this?' asked frodo again. \n","\n","'known?' said gandalf. 'i have known much that only the wise know, \n","frodo. but if you mean \"known about this ring\", well, i still do not know, \n","one might say. there is a last test to make. but i no longer doubt my guess. \n","\n","'when did i first begin to guess?' he mused, searching back in memory. \n","\n","'let me see - it was in the year that the white council drove the dark power \n","from mirkwood, just before the battle of five armies, that bilbo found his \n","ring. a shadow fell on my heart then, though i did not know yet what i \n","feared. i wondered often how gollum came by a great ring, as plainly it was \n","- that at least was clear from the first. then i heard bilbo's strange story \n","of how he had \"won\" it, and i could not believe it. when i at last got the \n","truth out of him, i saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to \n","the ring beyond doubt. much like gollum with his \"birthday present\". the \n","lies were too much alike for my comfort. clearly the ring had an unwholesome \n","power that set to work on its keeper at once. that was the first real \n","warning i had that all was not well. i told bilbo often that such rings were \n","better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. there was little \n","else that i could do. i could not take it from him without doing greater \n","harm; and i had no right to do so anyway. i could only watch and wait. i \n","might perhaps have consulted saruman the white, but something always held \n","me \n","back.' \n","\n","'who is he?' asked frodo. i have never heard of him before.' \n","\n","'maybe not,' answered gandalf. 'hobbits are, or were, no concern of \n","his. yet he is great among the wise. he is the chief of my order and the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","head of the council. his knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, \n","and he takes ill any meddling. the lore of the elven-rings, great and small, \n","is his province. he has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their \n","making; but when the rings were debated in the council, all that he would \n","reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. so my doubt slept - but \n","uneasily. still i watched and i waited. \n","\n","'and all seemed well with bilbo. and the years passed. yes, they \n","passed, and they seemed not to touch him. he showed no signs of age. the \n","shadow fell on me again. but i said to myself: \"after all he comes of a \n","long-lived family on his mother's side. there is time yet. wait!\" \n","\n","'and i waited. until that night when he left this house. he said and \n","did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of saruman could \n","allay. i knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. and i have \n","spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.' \n","\n","'there wasn't any permanent harm done, was there?' asked frodo \n","anxiously. 'he would get all right in time, wouldn't he? be able to rest in \n","peace, i mean?' \n","\n","'he felt better at once,' said gandalf. 'but there is only one power in \n","this world that knows all about the rings and their effects; and as far as i \n","know there is no power in the world that knows all about hobbits. among the \n","wise i am the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of \n","knowledge, but full of surprises. soft as butter they can be, and yet \n","sometimes as tough as old tree-roots. i think it likely that some would \n","resist the rings far longer than most of the wise would believe. i don't \n","think you need worry about bilbo. \n","\n","'of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it \n","might take a long while for the influence to wear off - before it was safe \n","for him to see it again, for instance. otherwise, he might live on for \n","years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with it. for he \n","gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. no, i was not \n","troubled about dear bilbo any more, once he had let the thing go. it is for \n","you that i feel responsible. \n","\n","'ever since bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about you, and \n","about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. it would be a grievous \n","blow to the world, if the dark power overcame the shire; if all your kind, \n","jolly, stupid bolgers, hornblowers, boffins, bracegirdles, and the rest, not \n","to mention the ridiculous bagginses, became enslaved.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","frodo shuddered. 'but why should we be?' he asked. 'and why should he \n","want such slaves?' \n","\n","'to tell you the truth,' replied gandalf, 'i believe that hitherto - \n","hitherto, mark you - he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits. \n","\n","you should be thankful. but your safety has passed. he does not need you - \n","he has many more useful servants - but he won't forget you again. and \n","hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and \n","free. there is such a thing as malice and revenge.' \n","\n","'revenge?' said frodo. 'revenge for what? i still don't understand what \n","all this has to do with bilbo and myself, and our ring.' \n","\n","'it has everything to do with it,' said gandalf. 'you do not know the \n","real peril yet; but you shall. i was not sure of it myself when i was last \n","here; but the time has come to speak. give me the ring for a moment.' \n","\n","frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain \n","that hung from his belt. he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the \n","wizard. it felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or frodo himself was in \n","some way reluctant for gandalf to touch it. \n","\n","gandalf held it up. it looked to be made of pure and solid gold. 'can \n","you see any markings on it?' he asked. \n","\n","'no,' said frodo. 'there are none. it is quite plain, and it never \n","shows a scratch or sign of wear.' \n","\n","'well then, look!' to frodo's astonishment and distress the wizard \n","threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire. frodo \n","gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but gandalf held him back. \n","\n","'wait!' he said in a commanding voice, giving frodo a quick look from \n","under his bristling brows. \n","\n","no apparent change came over the ring. after a while gandalf got up, \n","closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains. the room \n","became dark and silent, though the clack of sam's shears, now nearer to the \n","windows, could still be heard faintly from the garden. for a moment the \n","wizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to \n","the hearth with the tongs, and at once picked it up. frodo gasped. \n","\n","it is quite cool,' said gandalf. 'take it!' frodo received it on his \n","shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever. \n","\n","'hold it up!' said gandalf. 'and look closely!' \n","\n","as frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest \n","pen-strokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","seemed to form the letters of a flowing script. they shone piercingly \n","bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth. \n","\n","i cannot read the fiery letters,' said frodo in a quavering voice. \n","\n","'no,' said gandalf, 'but i can. the letters are elvish, of an ancient \n","mode, but the language is that of mordor, which i will not utter here. but \n","this in the common tongue is what is said, close enough: \n","\n","one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, \n","\n","one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. \n","\n","it is only two lines of a verse long known in elven-lore: \n","\n","three rings for the elven-kings under the sky, \n","\n","seven for the dwarf-lords in their halls of stone, \n","\n","nine for mortal men doomed to die, \n","\n","one for the dark lord on his dark throne \n","in the land of mordor where the shadows lie. \n","\n","one ring to rule them all. one ring to find them, \n","\n","one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them \n","in the land of mordor where the shadows lie. ' \n","\n","he paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: 'this is the \n","master -ring, the one ring to rule them all. this is the one ring that he \n","lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. he greatly desires \n","it - but he must not get it.' \n","\n","frodo sat silent and motionless. fear seemed to stretch out a vast \n","hand, like a dark cloud rising in the east and looming up to engulf him. \n","'this ring!' he stammered. 'how, how on earth did it come to me?' \n","\n","'ah!' said gandalf. 'that is a very long story. the beginnings lie back \n","in the black years, which only the lore-masters now remember. if i were to \n","tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when spring had \n","passed into winter. \n","\n","'but last night i told you of sauron the great, the dark lord. the \n","rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again and left \n","his hold in mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower \n","of mordor. that name even you hobbits have heard of, like a shadow on the \n","borders of old stories. always after a defeat and a respite, the shadow \n","takes another shape and grows again.' \n","\n","'i wish it need not have happened in my time,' said frodo. \n","\n","'so do i,' said gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. but \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","that is not for them to decide. all we have to decide is what to do with the \n","time that is given, us. and already, frodo, our time is beginning to look \n","black. the enemy is fast becoming very strong. his plans are far from ripe, \n","\n","i think, but they are ripening. we shall be hard put to it. we should be \n","very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance. \n","\n","'the enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to \n","beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover all the lands \n","in a second darkness. he lacks the one ring. \n","\n","'the three, fairest of all, the elf-lords hid from him, and his hand \n","never touched them or sullied them. seven the dwarf-kings possessed, but \n","three he has recovered, and the others the dragons have consumed. nine he \n","gave to mortal men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. long ago they \n","fell under the dominion of the one, and they became ringwraiths, shadows \n","under his great shadow, his most terrible servants. long ago. it is many a \n","year since the nine walked abroad. yet who knows? as the shadow grows \n","once \n","\n","more, they too may walk again. but come! we will not speak of such things \n","even in the morning of the shire. \n","\n","'so it is now: the nine he has gathered to himself; the seven also, or \n","else they are destroyed. the three are hidden still. but that no longer \n","troubles him. he only needs the one; for he made that ring himself, it is \n","his, and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it, so that \n","he could rule all the others. if he recovers it, then he will command them \n","all again, wherever they be, even the three, and all that has been wrought \n","with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever. \n","\n","'and this is the dreadful chance, frodo. he believed that the one had \n","perished; that the elves had destroyed it, as should have been done. but he \n","knows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. so he is seeking \n","it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it. it is his great hope and \n","our great fear.' \n","\n","'why, why wasn't it destroyed?' cried frodo. 'and how did the enemy \n","ever come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so precious to him?' \n","\n","he clutched the ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers \n","stretching out to seize it. \n","\n","'it was taken from him,' said gandalf. 'the strength of the elves to \n","resist him was greater long ago; and not all men were estranged from them. \n","the men of westernesse came to their aid. that is a chapter of ancient \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and \n","gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. \n","\n","one day, perhaps, i will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in \n","full by one who knows it best. \n","\n","'but for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing \n","came to you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that i will say. it \n","was gil-galad, elven-king and elendil of westernesse who overthrew sauron, \n","though they themselves perished in the deed; and isildur elendil's son cut \n","the ring from sauron's hand and took it for his own. then sauron was \n","vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years, until his \n","shadow took shape again in mirkwood. \n","\n","'but the ring was lost. it fell into the great river, anduin, and \n","vanished. for isildur was marching north along the east banks of the river, \n","and near the gladden fields he was waylaid by the ores of the mountains, and \n","almost all his folk were slain. he leaped into the waters, but the ring \n","slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the ores saw him and killed him \n","with arrows.' \n","\n","gandalf paused. 'and there in the dark pools amid the gladden fields,' \n","he said, 'the ring passed out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of \n","its history is known now only to a few, and the council of the wise could \n","discover no more. but at last i can carry on the story, i think. \n","\n","'fong after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the \n","great river on the edge of wilderland a clever -handed and quiet-footed \n","little people. i guess they were of hobbit -kind; akin to the fathers of the \n","fathers of the stoors, for they loved the river, and often swam in it, or \n","made little boats of reeds. there was among them a family of high repute, \n","for it was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother \n","of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they had. the most \n","inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called smjagol. he was \n","interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed \n","under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he \n","ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers \n","opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward. \n","\n","'he had a friend called djagol, of similar sort, sharper -eyed but not \n","so quick and strong. on a time they took a boat and went down to the gladden \n","fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. there \n","smjagol got out and went nosing about the banks but deal sat in the boat and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","fished. suddenly a great fish took his hook, and before he knew where he \n","was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to the bottom. then he let \n","go of his line, for he thought he saw something shining in the river-bed; \n","and holding his breath he grabbed at it. \n","\n","'then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful of \n","mud; and he swam to the bank. and behold! when he washed the mud away, \n","there \n","\n","in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the \n","sun, so that his heart was glad. but smjagol had been watching him from \n","behind a tree, and as deal gloated over the ring, smjagol came softly up \n","behind. \n","\n","\"'give us that, deal, my love,\" said smjagol, over his friend's \n","shoulder. \n","\n","'\"why?\" said deal. \n","\n","' \"because it's my birthday, my love, and i wants it,\" said smjagol. \n","\n","'\"i don't care,\" said deal. \"i have given you a present already, more \n","than i could afford. i found this, and i'm going to keep it.\" \n","\n","' \"oh, are you indeed, my love,\" said smjagol; and he caught deal by \n","the throat and strangled him, because the gold looked so bright and \n","beautiful. then he put the ring on his finger. \n","\n","'no one ever found out what had become of deal; he was murdered far \n","from home, and his body was cunningly hidden. but smjagol returned alone; \n","and he found that none of his family could see him, when he was wearing the \n","ring. he was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it; and he \n","used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and \n","malicious uses. he became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was \n","hurtful. the ring had given him power according to his stature. it is not to \n","be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when \n","visible) \n","\n","by all his relations. they kicked him, and he bit their feet. he took to \n","thieving, and going about muttering to himself, and gurgling in his throat. \n","\n","so they called him gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and \n","his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him \n","out of her hole. \n","\n","'he wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of the \n","world, and he journeyed up the river, till he came to a stream that flowed \n","down from the mountains, and he went that way. he caught fish in deep pools \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","with invisible fingers and ate them raw. one day it was very hot, and as he \n","was bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head) and a \n","dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. he wondered at it, for he \n","had almost forgotten about the sun. then for the last time he looked up and \n","shook his fist at her. \n","\n","'but as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above the tops of the misty \n","mountains, out of which the stream came. and he thought suddenly: \"it would \n","be cool and shady under those mountains. the sun could not watch me there. \n","the roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great \n","secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning.\" \n","\n","'so he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little \n","cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot \n","into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge. the ring \n","went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had \n","begun \n","\n","to grow again, could learn nothing of it.' \n","\n","'gollum!' cried frodo. 'gollum? do you mean that this is the very \n","gollum-creature that bilbo met? how loathsome!' \n","\n","'i think it is a sad story,' said the wizard, 'and it might have \n","happened to others, even to some hobbits that i have known.' \n","\n","'i can't believe that gollum was connected with hobbits, however \n","distantly,' said frodo with some heat. 'what an abominable notion!' \n","\n","'it is true all the same,' replied gandalf. 'about their origins, at \n","any rate, i know more than hobbits do themselves. and even bilbo's story \n","suggests the kinship. there was a great deal in the background of their \n","minds and memories that was very similar. they understood one another \n","remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a \n","dwarf, or an ore, or even an elf. think of the riddles they both knew, for \n","one thing.' \n","\n","'yes,' said frodo. 'though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and \n","of much the same sort. and hobbits don't cheat. gollum meant to cheat all \n","the time. he was just trying to put poor bilbo off his guard. and i daresay \n","it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him \n","with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.' \n","\n","'only too true, i fear,' said gandalf. 'but there was something else in \n","it, i think, which you don't see yet. even gollum was not wholly ruined. he \n","had proved tougher than even one of the wise would have guessed -as a hobbit \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","might. there was a little corner of his mind that was still his own, and \n","light came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the \n","past. it was actually pleasant, i think, to hear a kindly voice again, \n","bringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun on the grass, and such \n","forgotten things. \n","\n","'but that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in \n","the end - unless it could be conquered. unless it could be cured.' gandalf \n","sighed. 'alas! there is little hope of that for him. yet not no hope. no, \n","not though he possessed the ring so long, almost as far back as he can \n","remember. for it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness \n","it was seldom needed. certainly he had never \"faded\". he is thin and tough \n","still. but the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had \n","become almost unbearable. \n","\n","'all the \"great secrets\" under the mountains had turned out to be just \n","empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only \n","nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. he was altogether wretched. \n","he hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the \n","ring most of all.' \n","\n","'what do you mean?' said frodo. 'surely the ring was his precious and \n","the only thing he cared for? but if he hated it, why didn't he get rid of \n","it, or go away and leave it?' \n","\n","'you ought to begin to understand, frodo, after all you have heard,' \n","said gandalf. 'he hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. he \n","could not get rid of it. he had no will left in the matter. \n","\n","'a ring of power looks after itself, frodo. it may slip off \n","treacherously, but its keeper never abandons it. at most he plays with the \n","idea of handing it on to someone else's care - and that only at an early \n","stage, when it first begins to grip. but as far as i know bilbo alone in \n","history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. he needed all my \n","help, too. and even so he would never have just forsaken it, or cast it \n","aside. it was not gollum, frodo, but the ring itself that decided things. \n","\n","the ring left him. ' \n","\n","'what, just in time to meet bilbo?' said frodo. 'wouldn't an ore have \n","suited it better?' \n","\n","'it is no laughing matter,' said gandalf. 'not for you. it was the \n","strangest event in the whole history of the ring so far: bilbo's arrival \n","just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'there was more than one power at work, frodo. the ring was trying to \n","get back to its master. it had slipped from isildur's hand and betrayed him; \n","then when a chance came it caught poor deal, and he was murdered; and after \n","that gollum, and it had devoured him. it could make no further use of him: \n","he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never \n","leave his deep pool again. so now, when its master was awake once more and \n","sending out his dark thought from mirkwood, it abandoned gollum. only to \n","be \n","\n","picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: bilbo from the shire! \n","\n","'behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the \n","ring-maker. i can put it no plainer than by saying that bilbo was meant to \n","find the ring, and not by its maker. in which case you also were meant to \n","have it. and that maybe an encouraging thought.' \n","\n","it is not,' said frodo. \"though i am not sure that i understand you. \n","\n","but how have you learned all this about the ring, and about gollum? do you \n","really know it all, or are you just guessing still?' \n","\n","gandalf looked at frodo, and his eyes glinted. i knew much and i have \n","learned much,' he answered. 'but i am not going to give an account of all my \n","doings to you. the history of elendil and isildur and the one ring is known \n","to all the wise. your ring is shown to be that one ring by the fire- writing \n","alone, apart from any other evidence.' 'and when did you discover that?' \n","asked frodo, interrupting. 'just now in this room, of course,' answered the \n","wizard sharply. 'but i expected to find it. i have come back from dark \n","journeys and long search to make that final test. it is the last proof, and \n","all is now only too clear. making out gollum's part, and fitting it into the \n","gap in the history, required some thought. i may have started with guesses \n","about gollum, but i am not guessing now. i know. i have seen him.' \n","\n","'you have seen gollum?' exclaimed frodo in amazement. \n","\n","'yes. the obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. i tried long \n","ago; but i have managed it at last.' \n","\n","'then what happened after bilbo escaped from him? do you know that?' \n","\n","'not so clearly. what i have told you is what gollum was willing to \n","tell - though not, of course, in the way i have reported it. gollum is a \n","liar, and you have to sift his words. for instance, he called the ring his \n","\"birthday present\", and he stuck to that. he said it came from his \n","grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. a ridiculous \n","story. i have no doubt that smjagol's grandmother was a matriarch, a great \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many elven-rings was \n","absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. but a lie with a grain of \n","truth. \n","\n","'the murder of deal haunted gollum, and he had made up a defence, \n","repeating it to his \"precious\" over and over again, as he gnawed bones in \n","the dark, until he almost believed it. it was his birthday. deal ought to \n","have given the ring to him. it had previously turned up just so as to be a \n","present. it was his birthday present, and so on, and on. \n","\n","i endured him as long as i could, but the truth was desperately \n","important, and in the end i had to be harsh. i put the fear of fire on him, \n","and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much \n","snivelling and snarling. he thought he was misunderstood and ill-used. but \n","when he had at last told me his history, as far as the end of the \n","riddle-game and bilbo's escape, he would not say any more, except in dark \n","hints. some other fear was on him greater than mine. he muttered that he was \n","going to gel his own back. people would see if he would stand being kicked, \n","and driven into a hole and then robbed. gollum had good friends now, good \n","friends and very strong. they would help him. baggins would pay for it. that \n","was his chief thought. he hated bilbo and cursed his name. what is more, he \n","knew where he came from.' \n","\n","'but how did he find that out?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'well, as for the name, bilbo very foolishly told gollum himself; and \n","after that it would not be difficult to discover his country, once gollum \n","came out. oh yes, he came out. his longing for the ring proved stronger than \n","his fear of the ores, or even of the light. after a year or two he left the \n","mountains. you see, though still bound by desire of it, the ring was no \n","longer devouring him; he began to revive a little. he felt old, terribly \n","old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry. \n","\n","'light, light of sun and moon, he still feared and hated, and he always \n","will, i think; but he was cunning. he found he could hide from daylight and \n","moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his \n","pale cold eyes, and catch small frightened or unwary things. he grew \n","stronger and bolder with new food and new air. he found his way into \n","mirkwood, as one would expect.' \n","\n","'is that where you found him?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'i saw him there,' answered gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered \n","far, following bilbo's trail. it was difficult to learn anything from him \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats. \n","\n","\"what had it got in its pocketses?\" he said. \"it wouldn't say, no precious. \n","\n","little cheat. not a fair question. it cheated first, it did. it broke the \n","rules. we ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. and we will, precious!\" \n","\n","'that is a sample of his talk. i don't suppose you want any more. i had \n","weary days of it. but from hints dropped among the snarls i even gathered \n","that his padding feet had taken him at last to esgaroth, and even to the \n","streets of dale, listening secretly and peering. well, the news of the great \n","events went far and wide in wilderland, and many had heard bilbo's name and \n","knew where he came from. we had made no secret of our return journey to his \n","home in the west. gollum's sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.' \n","\n","'then why didn't he track bilbo further?' asked frodo. 'why didn't he \n","come to the shire?' \n","\n","'ah,' said gandalf, 'now we come to it. i think gollum tried to. he set \n","out and came back westward, as far as the great river. but then he turned \n","aside. he was not daunted by the distance, i am sure. no, something else \n","drew him away. so my friends think, those that hunted him for me. \n","\n","'the wood -elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail \n","was still fresh then. through mirkwood and back again it led them, though \n","they never caught him. the wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful \n","tales even among beasts and birds. the woodmen said that there was some \n","new \n","\n","terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. it climbed trees to find nests; it \n","crept into holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find \n","cradles. \n","\n","'but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away. it wandered \n","off southwards and passed out of the wood-elves' ken, and was lost. and then \n","i made a great mistake. yes, frodo, and not the first; though i fear it may \n","prove the worst. i let the matter be. i let him go; for i had much else to \n","think of at that time, and i still trusted the lore of saruman. \n","\n","'well, that was years ago. i have paid for it since with many dark and \n","dangerous days. the trail was long cold when i took it up again, after bilbo \n","left here. and my search would have been in vain, but for the help that i \n","had from a friend: aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age \n","of the world. together we sought for gollum down the whole length of \n","wilderland, without hope, and without success. but at last, when i had given \n","up the chase and turned to other parts, gollum was found. my friend returned \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him. \n","\n","'what he had been doing he would not say. he only wept and called us \n","cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined \n","and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they \n","pained him, as if he remembered some old torture. but i am afraid there is \n","no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by \n","mile, south, down at last to the land of mordor.' \n","\n","a heavy silence fell in the room. frodo could hear his heart beating. \n","\n","even outside everything seemed still. no sound of sam's shears could now be \n","heard. \n","\n","'yes, to mordor,' said gandalf. 'alas! mordor draws all wicked things, \n","and the dark power was bending all its will to gather them there. the ring \n","of the enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open to the summons. and \n","all folk were whispering then of the new shadow in the south, and its hatred \n","of the west. there were his fine new friends, who would help him in his \n","revenge ! \n","\n","'wretched fool! in that land he would learn much, too much for his \n","comfort. and sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would \n","be caught, and taken - for examination. that was the way of it, i fear. when \n","he was found he had already been there long, and was on his way back. on \n","some errand of mischief. but that does not matter much now. his worst \n","mischief was done. \n","\n","'yes, alas! through him the enemy has learned that the one has been \n","found again. he knows where isildur fell. he knows where gollum found his \n","ring. he knows that it is a great ring, for it gave long life. he knows that \n","it is not one of the three, for they have never been lost, and they endure \n","no evil. he knows that it is not one of the seven, or the nine, for they are \n","accounted for. he knows that it is the one. and he has at last heard, i \n","think, of hobbits and the shire. \n","\n","'the shire - he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found \n","out where it lies. indeed, frodo, i fear that he may even think that the \n","long -unnoticed name of baggins has become important.' \n","\n","'but this is terrible!' cried frodo. 'far worse than the worst that i \n","imagined from your hints and warnings. o gandalf, best of friends, what am i \n","to do? for now i am really afraid. what am i to do? what a pity that bilbo \n","did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!' \n","\n","'pity? it was pity that stayed his hand. pity, and mercy: not to strike \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","without need. and he has been well rewarded, frodo. be sure that he took so \n","little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his \n","ownership of the ring so. with pity.' \n","\n","'i am sorry,' said frodo. 'but i am frightened; and i do not feel any \n","pity for gollum.' \n","\n","'you have not seen him,' gandalf broke in. \n","\n","'no, and i don't want to,' said frodo. i can't understand you. do you \n","mean to say that you, and the elves, have let him live on after all those \n","horrible deeds? now at any rate he is as bad as an ore, and just an enemy. \n","he deserves death.' \n","\n","'deserves it! i daresay he does. many that live deserve death. and some \n","that die deserve life. can you give it to them? then do not be too eager to \n","deal out death in judgement. for even the very wise cannot see all ends. i \n","have not much hope that gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a \n","chance of it. and he is bound up with the fate of the ring. my heart tells \n","me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and \n","when that comes, the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not \n","least. in any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. \n","\n","the wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as \n","they can find in their wise hearts.' \n","\n","'all the same,' said frodo, 'even if bilbo could not kill gollum, i \n","wish he had not kept the ring. i wish he had never found it, and that i had \n","not got it! why did you let me keep it? why didn't you make me throw it \n","away, or, or destroy it?' \n","\n","'let you? make you?' said the wizard. 'haven't you been listening to \n","all that i have said? you are not thinking of what you are saying. but as \n","for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. these rings have a way of \n","being found. in evil hands it might have done great evil. worst of all, it \n","might have fallen into the hands of the enemy. indeed it certainly would; \n","for this is the one, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it \n","to himself. \n","\n","'of course, my dear frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has \n","troubled me deeply. but there was so much at stake that i had to take some \n","risk - though even when i was far away there has never been a day when the \n","shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. as long as you never used it, i \n","did not think that the ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for \n","evil, not at any rate for a very long time. and you must remember that nine \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","years ago, when i last saw you, i still knew little for certain.' \n","\n","'but why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?' \n","cried frodo again. if you had warned me, or even sent me a message, i would \n","have done away with it.' \n","\n","'would you? how would you do that? have you ever tried?' \n","\n","'no. but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it.' \n","\n","'try!' said gandalf. try now!' \n","\n","frodo drew the ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. it now \n","appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he could see. the \n","gold looked very fair and pure, and frodo thought how rich and beautiful was \n","its colour, how perfect was its roundness. it was an admirable thing and \n","altogether precious. when he took it out he had intended to fling it from \n","him into the very hottest part of the fire. but he found now that he could \n","not do so, not without a great struggle. he weighed the ring in his hand, \n","hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that gandalf had told him; \n","and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away - \n","but he found that he had put it back in his pocket. \n","\n","gandalf laughed grimly. 'you see? already you too, frodo, cannot easily \n","let it go, nor will to damage it. and i could not \"make\" you - except by \n","force, which would break your mind. but as for breaking the ring, force is \n","useless. even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it \n","would make no dint in it. it cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine. \n","\n","'your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. this \n","ring has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. but there \n","is no smith's forge in this shire that could change it at all. not even the \n","anvils and furnaces of the dwarves could do that. it has been said that \n","dragon-fire could melt and consume the rings of power, but there is not now \n","any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there \n","ever any dragon, not even ancalagon the black, who could have harmed the \n","one \n","\n","ring, the ruling ring, for that was made by sauron himself. there is only \n","one way: to find the cracks of doom in the depths of orodruin, the \n","fire-mountain, and cast the ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, \n","to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever.' \n","\n","'i do really wish to destroy it!' cried frodo. 'or, well, to have it \n","destroyed. i am not made for perilous quests. i wish i had never seen the \n","ring ! why did it come to me? why was i chosen?' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'such questions cannot be answered,' said gandalf. 'you may be sure \n","that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power or \n","wisdom, at any rate. but you have been chosen, and you must therefore use \n","such strength and heart and wits as you have.' \n","\n","'but i have so little of any of these things! you are wise and \n","powerful. will you not take the ring?' \n","\n","'no!' cried gandalf, springing to his feet. 'with that power i should \n","have power too great and terrible. and over me the ring would gain a power \n","still greater and more deadly.' his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by \n","a fire within. 'do not tempt me! for i do not wish to become like the dark \n","lord himself. yet the way of the ring to my heart is by pity, pity for \n","weakness and the desire of strength to do good. do not tempt me! i dare not \n","take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. the wish to wield it would be too \n","great, for my strength. i shall have such need of it. great perils lie \n","before me.' \n","\n","he went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. \n","sunlight streamed back again into the room. sam passed along the path \n","outside whistling. 'and now,' said the wizard, turning back to frodo, 'the \n","decision lies with you. but i will always help you.' he laid his hand on \n","frodo's shoulder. 'i will help you bear this burden, as long as it is yours \n","to bear. but we must do something, soon. the enemy is moving.' \n","\n","there was a long silence. gandalf sat down again and puffed at his \n","pipe, as if lost in thought. his eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he \n","was watching frodo intently. frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the \n","hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down \n","into profound wells of fire. he was thinking of the fabled cracks of doom \n","and the terror of the fiery mountain. \n","\n","'well!' said gandalf at last. 'what are you thinking about? have you \n","decided what to do?' \n","\n","'no!' answered frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and \n","finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he \n","could see the sunlit garden. 'or perhaps, yes. as far as i understand what \n","you have said, i suppose i must keep the ring and guard it, at least for the \n","present, whatever it may do to me.' \n","\n","'whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with \n","that purpose,' said gandalf. \n","\n","'i hope so,' said frodo. 'but i hope that you may find some other \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","better keeper soon. but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a danger, a \n","danger to all that live near me. i cannot keep the ring and stay here. i \n","ought to leave bag end, leave the shire, leave everything and go away.' he \n","sighed. \n","\n","'i should like to save the shire, if i could - though there have been \n","times when i thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have \n","felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. \n","but i don't feel like that now. i feel that as long as the shire lies \n","behind, safe and comfortable, i shall find wandering more bearable: i shall \n","know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand \n","there again. \n","\n","'of course, i have sometimes thought of going away, but i imagined that \n","as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like bilbo's or better, ending \n","in peace. but this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, \n","drawing it after me. and i suppose i must go alone, if i am to do that and \n","save the shire. but i feel very small, and very uprooted, and well - \n","desperate. the enemy is so strong and terrible.' \n","\n","he did not tell gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to \n","follow bilbo flamed up in his heart - to follow bilbo, and even perhaps to \n","find him again. it was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost \n","have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as bilbo had done \n","on a similar morning long ago. \n","\n","'my dear frodo!' exclaimed gandalf. 'hobbits really are amazing \n","creatures, as i have said before. you can learn all that there is to know \n","about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still \n","surprise you at a pinch. i hardly expected to get such an answer, not even \n","from you. but bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little \n","thought how important it would prove. i am afraid you are right. the ring \n","will not be able to stay hidden in the shire much longer; and for your own \n","sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of \n","baggins behind you. that name will not be safe to have, outside the shire or \n","in the wild. i will give you a travelling name now. when you go, go as mr. \n","underhill. \n","\n","'but i don't think you need go alone. not if you know of anyone you can \n","trust, and who would be willing to go by your side - and that you would be \n","willing to take into unknown perils. but if you look for a companion, be \n","careful in choosing! and be careful of what you say, even to your closest \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","friends! the enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.' \n","\n","suddenly he stopped as if listening. frodo became aware that all was \n","very quiet, inside and outside. gandalf crept to one side of the window. \n","then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and \n","downwards. there was a squawk, and up came sam gamgee's curly head \n","hauled by \n","one ear. \n","\n","'well, well, bless my beard!' said gandalf. 'sam gamgee is it? now what \n","may you be doing?' \n","\n","'lor bless you, mr. gandalf, sir!' said sam. 'nothing! leastways i was \n","just trimming the grass-border under the window, if you follow me.' he \n","picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence. \n","\n","'i don't,' said gandalf grimly. it is some time since i last heard the \n","sound of your shears. how long have you been eavesdropping?' \n","\n","'eavesdropping, sir? i don't follow you, begging your pardon. there \n","ain't no eaves at bag end, and that's a fact.' \n","\n","'don't be a fool! what have you heard, and why did you listen?' \n","gandalf s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles. \n","\n","'mr. frodo, sir!' cried sam quaking. 'don't let him hurt me, sir! don't \n","let him turn me into anything unnatural! my old dad would take on so. i \n","meant no harm, on my honour, sir!' \n","\n","'he won't hurt you,' said frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, \n","although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. 'he knows, as well as i \n","do, that you mean no harm. but just you up and answer his questions straight \n","away!' \n","\n","'well, sir,' said sam dithering a little. 'i heard a deal that i didn't \n","rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and mr. bilbo, sir, and \n","dragons, and a fiery mountain, and - and elves, sir. i listened because i \n","couldn't help myself, if you know what i mean. lor bless me, sir, but i do \n","love tales of that sort. and i believe them too, whatever ted may say. \n","elves, sir! i would dearly love to see them. couldn't you take me to see \n","elves, sir, when you go?' \n","\n","suddenly gandalf laughed. 'come inside!' he shouted, and putting out \n","both his arms he lifted the astonished sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, \n","right through the window and stood him on the floor. 'take you to see elves, \n","eh?' he said, eyeing sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his face. \n","\n","'so you heard that mr. frodo is going away?' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'i did, sir. and that's why i choked: which you heard seemingly. i \n","tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: i was so upset.' \n","\n","'it can't be helped, sam,' said frodo sadly. he had suddenly realized \n","that flying from the shire would mean more painful partings than merely \n","saying farewell to the familiar comforts of bag end. 'i shall have to go. \n","but' - and here he looked hard at sam - 'if you really care about me, you \n","will keep that dead secret. see? if you don't, if you even breathe a word of \n","what you've heard here, then i hope gandalf will turn you into a spotted \n","toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.' \n","\n","sam fell on his knees, trembling. 'get up, sam!' said gandalf. i have \n","thought of something better than that. something to shut your mouth, and \n","punish you properly for listening. you shall go away with mr. frodo!' \n","\n","'me, sir!' cried sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. 'me \n","go and see elves and all! hooray!' he shouted, and then burst into tears. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 3 . three is company \n","\n","\n","\n","'you ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,' said gandalf. two \n","or three weeks had passed, and still frodo made no sign of getting ready to \n","\n","go- \n","\n","'i know. but it is difficult to do both,' he objected. if i just vanish \n","like bilbo, the tale will be all over the shire in no time.' \n","\n","'of course you mustn't vanish!' said gandalf. 'that wouldn't do at all! \n","\n","i said soon, not instantly. if you can think of any way of slipping out of \n","the shire without its being generally known, it will be worth a little \n","delay. but you must not delay too long.' \n","\n","'what about the autumn, on or after our birthday?' asked frodo. 'i \n","think i could probably make some arrangements by then.' \n","\n","to tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come \n","to the point. bag end seemed a more desirable residence than it had for \n","years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the \n","shire. when autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart would think \n","more kindly of journeying, as it always did at that season. he had indeed \n","privately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday: bilbo's one \n","hundred and twenty-eighth. it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set \n","out and follow him. following bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one \n","thing that made the thought of leaving bearable. he thought as little as \n","possible about the ring, and where it might lead him in the end. but he did \n","not tell all his thoughts to gandalf. what the wizard guessed was always \n","difficult to tell. \n","\n","he looked at frodo and smiled. 'very well,' he said. 'i think that will \n","do - but it must not be any later. i am getting very anxious. in the \n","mean-while, do take care, and don't let out any hint of where you are going! \n","and see that sam gamgee does not talk. if he does, i really shall turn him \n","into a toad.' \n","\n","'as for where i am going,' said frodo, 'it would be difficult to give \n","that away, for i have no clear idea myself, yet.' \n","\n","'don't be absurd!' said gandalf. 'i am not warning you against leaving \n","an address at the post-office! but you are leaving the shire - and that \n","should not be known, until you are far away. and you must go, or at least \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","set out, either north, south, west or east - and the direction should \n","certainly not be known.' \n","\n","'i have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving bag end, and of \n","saying farewell, that i have never even considered the direction,' said \n","frodo. 'for where am i to go? and by what shall i steer? what is to be my \n","quest? bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back again; but i go to lose \n","one, and not return, as far as i can see.' \n","\n","'but you cannot see very far,' said gandalf. 'neither can i. it may be \n","your task to find the cracks of doom; but that quest may be for others: i do \n","not know. at any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.' \n","\n","'no indeed!' said frodo. 'but in the meantime what course am i to \n","lake?' \n","\n","'towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,' answered the \n","wizard. 'if you want my advice, make for rivendell. that journey should not \n","prove too perilous, though the road is less easy than it was, and it will \n","grow worse as the year fails.' \n","\n","'rivendell!' said frodo. 'very good: i will go east, and i will make \n","for rivendell. i will take sam to visit the elves; he will be delighted.' he \n","spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the \n","house of elrond halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep valley where \n","many of the fair folk still dwelt in peace. \n","\n","one summer's evening an astonishing piece of news reached the ivy bush \n","and green dragon. giants and other portents on the borders of the shire were \n","forgotten for more important matters: mr. frodo was selling bag end, indeed \n","he had already sold it - to the sackville-bagginses! \n","\n","'for a nice bit, loo,' said some. 'at a bargain price,' said others, \n","\n","'and that's more likely when mistress fobelia's the buyer.' (otho had died \n","some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.) \n","\n","just why mr. frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more \n","debatable than the price. a few held the theory - supported by the nods and \n","hints of mr. baggins himself - that frodo's money was running out: he was \n","going to leave hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale \n","down in buckland among his brandybuck relations. 'as far from the \n","sackville-bagginses as may be,' some added. but so firmly fixed had the \n","notion of the immeasurable wealth of the bagginses of bag end become that \n","most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason \n","that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","unrevealed plot by gandalf. though he kept himself very quiet and did not go \n","about by day, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in the bag end'. but \n","however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was \n","no doubt about the fact: frodo baggins was going back to buckland. \n","\n","'yes, i shall be moving this autumn,' he said. 'merry brandybuck is \n","looking out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.' \n","\n","as a matter of fact with merry's help he had already chosen and bought \n","a little house at crickhollow in the country beyond bucklebury. to all but \n","sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. the decision \n","to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for buckland was on the \n","eastern borders of the shire, and as he had lived there in childhood his \n","going back would at least seem credible. \n","\n","gandalf stayed in the shire for over two months. then one evening, at \n","the end of june, soon after frodo's plan had been finally arranged, he \n","suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning. 'only for a \n","short while, i hope,' he said. 'but i am going down beyond the southern \n","borders to get some news, if i can. i have been idle longer than i should.' \n","\n","he spoke lightly, but it seemed to frodo that he looked rather worried. \n","\n","'has anything happened?' he asked. \n","\n","'well no; but i have heard something that has made me anxious and needs \n","looking into. if i think it necessary after all for you to get off at once, \n","\n","i shall come back immediately, or at least send word. in the meanwhile stick \n","to your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the ring. fet me \n","impress on you once more: don't use it!' \n","\n","he went off at dawn. 'i may be back any day,' he said. 'at the very \n","latest i shall come back for the farewell party. i think after all you may \n","need my company on the road.' \n","\n","at first frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what \n","gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine \n","weather he forgot his troubles for a while. the shire had seldom seen so \n","fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey \n","was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full. \n","\n","autumn was well under way before frodo began to worry about gandalf \n","again. september was passing and there was still no news of him. the \n","birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he did not come, or send \n","word. bag end began to be busy. some of frodo's friends came to stay and \n","help him with the packing: there was fredegar bolger and folco boffin, and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","of course his special friends pippin took and merry brandybuck. between \n","them \n","\n","they turned the whole place upside-down. \n","\n","on september 20th two covered carts went off laden to buckland, \n","conveying the furniture and goods that frodo had not sold to his new home, \n","by way of the brandywine bridge. the next day frodo became really anxious, \n","and kept a constant look-out for gandalf. thursday, his birthday morning, \n","dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for bilbo's great party. still \n","gandalf did not appear. in the evening frodo gave his farewell feast: it was \n","quite small, just a dinner for himself and his four helpers; but he was \n","troubled and fell in no mood for it. the thought that he would so soon have \n","to part with his young friends weighed on his heart. he wondered how he \n","would break it to them. \n","\n","the four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party \n","soon became very cheerful in spite of gandalf s absence. the dining-room was \n","bare except for a table and chairs, but the food was good, and there was \n","good wine: frodo's wine had not been included in the sale to the \n","sackville-bagginses. \n","\n","'whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the s.-b.s get their \n","claws on it, at any rate i have found a good home for this!' said frodo, as \n","he drained his glass. it was the last drop of old winyards. \n","\n","when they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done \n","together, they toasted bilbo's birthday, and they drank his health and \n","frodo's together according to frodo's custom. then they went out for a sniff \n","of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed. frodo's party \n","was over, and gandalf had not come. \n","\n","the next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder \n","of the luggage. merry took charge of this, and drove off with fatty (that is \n","fredegar bolger). 'someone must get there and warm the house before you \n","arrive,' said merry. 'well, see you later - the day after tomorrow, if you \n","don't go to sleep on the way!' \n","\n","folco went home after lunch, but pippin remained behind. frodo was \n","restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of gandalf. he decided \n","to wait until nightfall. after that, if gandalf wanted him urgently, he \n","would go to crickhollow, and might even get there first. for frodo was going \n","on foot. his plan - for pleasure and a last look at the shire as much as any \n","other reason - was to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferry, taking it \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","fairly easy. \n","\n","'i shall get myself a bit into training, too,' he said, looking at \n","himself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. he had not done any \n","strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection looked rather flabby, \n","he thought. \n","\n","after lunch, the sackville-bagginses, lobelia and her sandy-haired son, \n","lotho, turned up, much to frodo's annoyance. 'ours at last!' said lobelia, \n","as she stepped inside. it was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of \n","bag end did not take effect until midnight. but lobelia can perhaps be \n","forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years longer for \n","bag end than she once hoped, and she was now a hundred years old. \n","anyway, \n","\n","she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and \n","she wanted the keys. it took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought \n","a complete inventory with her and went right through it. in the end she \n","departed with lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key \n","would be left at the gamgees' in bagshot row. she snorted, and showed \n","plainly that she thought the gamgees capable of plundering the hole during \n","the night. frodo did not offer her any tea. \n","\n","he took his own tea with pippin and sam gamgee in the kitchen. it had \n","been officially announced that sam was coming to buckland 'to do for mr. \n","frodo and look after his bit of garden'; an arrangement that was approved by \n","the gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having lobelia \n","as a neighbour. \n","\n","'our last meal at bag end!' said frodo, pushing back his chair. they \n","left the washing up for lobelia. pippin and sam strapped up their three \n","packs and piled them in the porch. pippin went out for a last stroll in the \n","garden. sam disappeared. \n","\n","the sun went down. bag end seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. \n","frodo \n","\n","wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on \n","the walls, and shadows creep out of the corners. it grew slowly dark \n","indoors. he went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path, \n","and then on a short way down the hill road. he half expected to see gandalf \n","come striding up through the dusk. \n","\n","the sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. 'it's going to be \n","a fine night,' he said aloud. 'that's good for a beginning. i feel like \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","walking. i can't bear any more hanging about. i am going to start, and \n","gandalf must follow me.' he turned to go back, and then slopped, for he \n","heard voices, just round the corner by the end of bagshot row. one voice was \n","certainly the old gaffer's; the other was strange, and somehow unpleasant. \n","\n","he could not make out what it said, but he heard the gaffer's answers, which \n","were rather shrill. the old man seemed put out. \n","\n","'no, mr. baggins has gone away. went this morning, and my sam went \n","with \n","\n","him: anyway all his stuff went. yes, sold out and gone, i tell'ee. why? \n","why's none of my business, or yours. where to? that ain't no secret. he's \n","moved to bucklebury or some such place, away down yonder. yes it is - a tidy \n","way. i've never been so far myself; they're queer folks in buckland. no, i \n","can't give no message. good night to you!' \n","\n","footsteps went away down the hill. frodo wondered vaguely why the fact \n","that they did not come on up the hill seemed a great relief. 'i am sick of \n","questions and curiosity about my doings, i suppose,' he thought. 'what an \n","inquisitive lot they all are!' he had half a mind to go and ask the gaffer \n","who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and \n","walked quickly back to bag end. \n","\n","pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. sam was not there. frodo \n","stepped inside the dark door. 'sam!' he called. 'sam! time!' \n","\n","'coming, sir!' came the answer from far within, followed soon by sam \n","himself, wiping his mouth. he had been saying farewell to the beer -barrel in \n","the cellar. \n","\n","'all aboard, sam?' said frodo. \n","\n","'yes, sir. i'll last for a bit now, sir.' \n","\n","frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to sam. 'run \n","down with this to your home, sam!' he said. 'then cut along the row and meet \n","us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows. we are \n","not going through the village tonight. too many ears pricking and eyes \n","prying.' sam ran off at full speed. \n","\n","'well, now we're off at last!' said frodo. they shouldered their packs \n","and took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to the west side of \n","bag end. 'good-bye!' said frodo, looking at the dark blank windows. he \n","waved \n","\n","his hand, and then turned and (following bilbo, if he had known it) hurried \n","after peregrin down the garden-path. they jumped over the low place in the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a \n","rustle in the grasses. \n","\n","at the bottom of the hill on its western side they came to the gate \n","opening on to a narrow lane. there they halted and adjusted the straps of \n","their packs. presently sam appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard; \n","his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head \n","a tall shapeless fell bag, which he called a hat. in the gloom he looked \n","very much like a dwarf. \n","\n","'i am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,' said frodo. 'i \n","pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.' \n","\n","'i could take a lot more yet, sir. my packet is quite light,' said sam \n","stoutly and untruthfully. \n","\n","'no, you don't, sam!' said pippin. 'it is good for him. he's got \n","nothing except what he ordered us to pack. he's been slack lately, and he'll \n","feel the weight less when he's walked off some of his own.' \n","\n","'be kind to a poor old hobbit!' laughed frodo. 'i shall be as thin as a \n","willow-wand, i'm sure, before i get to buckland. but i was talking nonsense. \n","\n","i suspect you have taken more than your share, sam, and i shall look into it \n","at our next packing.' he picked up his stick again. 'well, we all like \n","walking in the dark,' he said, 'so let's put some miles behind us before \n","bed.' \n","\n","for a short way they followed the lane westwards. then leaving it they \n","turned left and took quietly to the fields again. they went in single file \n","along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them. \n","in their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings. \n","\n","since they were all hobbits, and were trying to be silent, they made no \n","noise that even hobbits would hear. even the wild things in the fields and \n","woods hardly noticed their passing. \n","\n","after some time they crossed the water, west of hobbiton, by a narrow \n","plank -bridge. the stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon, \n","bordered with leaning alder -trees. a mile or two further south they hastily \n","crossed the great road from the brandywine bridge; they were now in the \n","tookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the green hill country. \n","as they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps \n","in hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the water. soon it \n","disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by by water \n","beside its grey pool. when the light of the last farm was far behind, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","peeping among the trees, frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell. \n","\n","'i wonder if i shall ever look down into that valley again,' he said \n","quietly. \n","\n","when they had walked for about three hours they rested. the night was \n","clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the \n","hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. thin-clad birches, swaying in \n","a light wind above their heads, made a black net against the pale sky. they \n","ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again. soon they \n","struck a narrow road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the \n","darkness ahead: the road to woodhall, and stock, and the bucklebury ferry. \n","it climbed away from the main road in the water -valley, and wound over the \n","skirts of the green hills towards woody-end, a wild corner of the \n","eastfarthing. \n","\n","after a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall \n","trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. it was very dark. at first \n","they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from \n","inquisitive ears. then they marched on in silence, and pippin began to lag \n","behind. at last, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and \n","yawned. \n","\n","'i am so sleepy,' he said, 'that soon i shall fall down on the road. \n","\n","are you going to sleep on your legs? it is nearly midnight.' \n","\n","'i thought you liked walking in the dark,' said frodo. 'but there is no \n","great hurry. merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow; but that \n","leaves us nearly two days more. we'll halt at the first likely spot.' \n","\n","'the wind's in the west,' said sam. 'if we get to the other side of \n","this hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough, sir. \n","\n","there is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if i remember rightly.' sam knew the \n","land well within twenty miles of hobbiton, but that was the limit of his \n","geography. \n","\n","just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood. \n","\n","leaving the road they went into the deep resin-scented darkness of the \n","trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire. soon they had a \n","merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it \n","for a while, until they began to nod. then, each in an angle of the great \n","tree's roots, they curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and were soon \n","fast asleep. they set no watch; even frodo feared no danger yet, for they \n","were still in the heart of the shire. a few creatures came and looked at \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","them when the fire had died away. a fox passing through the wood on business \n","of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed. \n","\n","'hobbits!' he thought. 'well, what next? i have heard of strange doings \n","in this land, but i have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors \n","under a tree. three of them! there's something mighty queer behind this.' he \n","was quite right, but he never found out any more about it. \n","\n","the morning came, pale and clammy. frodo woke up first, and found that \n","a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff. \n","\n","'walking for pleasure! why didn't i drive?' he thought, as he usually \n","did at the beginning of an expedition. 'and all my beautiful feather beds \n","are sold to the sackville-bagginses! these tree-roots would do them good.' \n","\n","he stretched. 'wake up, hobbits!' he cried. it's a beautiful morning.' \n","\n","'what's beautiful about it?' said pippin, peering over the edge of his \n","blanket with one eye. 'sam! gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! have you \n","got the bath-water hot?' \n","\n","sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. 'no, sir, i haven't, sir!' he \n","said. \n","\n","frodo stripped the blankets from pippin and rolled him over, and then \n","walked off to the edge of the wood. away eastward the sun was rising red out \n","of the mists that lay thick on the world. touched with gold and red the \n","autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. a little below \n","him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared. \n","\n","when he returned sam and pippin had got a good fire going. 'water!' \n","shouted pippin. 'where's the water?' \n","\n","'i don't keep water in my pockets,' said frodo. 'we thought you had \n","gone to find some,' said pippin, busy setting out the food, and cups. 'you \n","had better go now.' \n","\n","'you can come too,' said frodo, 'and bring all the water-bottles.' \n","\n","there was a stream at the foot of the hill. they filled their bottles and \n","the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet \n","over an outcrop of grey stone. it was icy cold; and they spluttered and \n","puffed as they bathed their faces and hands. \n","\n","when their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it \n","was after ten o'clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. they \n","went down the slope, and across the stream where it dived under the road, \n","and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by \n","that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, and other gear already seemed \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","a heavy burden. \n","\n","the day's march promised to be warm and tiring work. after some miles, \n","however, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a \n","steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to go down \n","for the last time. in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with \n","small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland \n","haze. they were looking across the woody end towards the brandywine \n","river. \n","\n","the road wound away before them like a piece of string. \n","\n","'the road goes on for ever,' said pippin; 'but i can't without a rest. \n","\n","it is high time for lunch.' he sat down on the bank at the side of the road \n","and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the river, and the end \n","of the shire in which he had spent all his life. sam stood by him. his round \n","eyes were wide open - for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a \n","new horizon. \n","\n","'do elves live in those woods?' he asked. \n","\n","'not that i ever heard,' said pippin. frodo was silent. he too was \n","gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before. suddenly \n","he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly: \n","\n","the road goes ever on and on \n","down from the door where it began. \n","\n","now far ahead the road has gone, \n","\n","and i must follow, if i can, \n","\n","pursuing it with weary feet, \n","\n","until it joins some larger way, \n","\n","where many paths and errands meet. \n","\n","and whither then? i cannot say. \n","\n","'that sounds like a bit of old bilbo's rhyming,' said pippin. 'or is it \n","one of your imitations? it does not sound altogether encouraging.' \n","\n","'i don't know,' said frodo. it came to me then, as if i was making it \n","up; but i may have heard it long ago. certainly it reminds me very much of \n","bilbo in the last years, before he went away. he used often to say there was \n","only one road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every \n","doorstep, and every path was its tributary. \"it's a dangerous business, \n","frodo, going out of your door,\" he used to say. \"you step into the road, and \n","if you don't keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept \n","off to. do you realize that this is the very path that goes through \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","mirkwood, and that if you let it, it might take you to the lonely mountain \n","or even further and to worse places?\" he used to say that on the path \n","outside the front door at bag end, especially after he had been out for a \n","long walk.' \n","\n","'well, the road won't sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,' said \n","pippin, unslinging his pack. the others followed his example, putting their \n","packs against the bank and their legs out into the road. after a rest they \n","had a good lunch, and then more rest. \n","\n","the sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the \n","land as they went down the hill. so far they had not met a soul on the road. \n","this way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little \n","traffic to the woody end. they had been jogging along again for an hour or \n","more when sam stopped a moment as if listening. they were now on level \n","ground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through \n","grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods. \n","\n","'i can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said sam. \n","\n","they looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing \n","far. 'i wonder if that is gandalf coming after us,' said frodo; but even as \n","he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide \n","from the view of the rider came over him. \n","\n","'it may not matter much,' he said apologetically, 'but i would rather \n","not be seen on the road - by anyone. i am sick of my doings being noticed \n","and discussed. and if it is gandalf,' he added as an afterthought, 'we can \n","give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. let's get out \n","of sight!' \n","\n","the other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not \n","far from the road. there they lay flat. frodo hesitated for a second: \n","curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide. the \n","sound of hoofs drew nearer. just in time he threw himself down in a patch of \n","long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. then he lifted his head \n","and peered cautiously above one of the great roots. \n","\n","round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized \n","horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle, \n","wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his boots in the high \n","stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible. \n","\n","when it reached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stopped. \n","\n","the riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. from \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive \n","scent; the head turned from side to side of the road. \n","\n","a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo, and he \n","thought of his ring. he hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get \n","it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. \n","\n","he felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe. the \n","advice of gandalf seemed absurd. bilbo had used the ring. 'and i am still in \n","the shire,' he thought, as his hand touched the chain on which it hung. at \n","that moment the rider sat up, and shook the reins. the horse stepped \n","forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot. \n","\n","frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he \n","dwindled into the distance. he could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him \n","that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and \n","went into the trees on the right. \n","\n","'well, i call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said frodo to \n","himself, as he walked towards his companions. pippin and sam had remained \n","flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so frodo described the rider and \n","his strange behaviour. \n","\n","'i can't say why, but i felt certain he was looking or smelling for me; \n","and also i felt certain that i did not want him to discover me. i've never \n","seen or fell anything like it in the shire before.' \n","\n","'but what has one of the big people got to do with us?' said pippin. \n","\n","'and what is he doing in this part of the world?' \n","\n","'there are some men about,' said frodo. 'down in the southfarthing they \n","have had trouble with big people, i believe. but i have never heard of \n","anything like this rider. i wonder where he comes from.' \n","\n","'begging your pardon,' put in sam suddenly, 'i know where he comes \n","from. it's from hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there's \n","more than one. and i know where he's going to.' \n","\n","'what do you mean?' said frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. \n","'why didn't you speak up before?' \n","\n","'i have only just remembered, sir. it was like this: when i got back to \n","our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: hello, sam! \n","he says. i thought you were away with mr. frodo this morning. there's been a \n","strange customer asking for mr. baggins of bag end, and he's only just gone. \n","i've sent him on to bucklebury. not that hiked the sound of him. he seemed \n","mighty put out, when i told him mr. baggins had left his old home for good. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","hissed at me, he did. it gave me quite a shudder. what sort of a fellow was \n","he? says i to the gaffer. / don 't know, says he; but he wasn 't a hobbit. he \n","was tall and black-like, and he stooped aver me. i reckon it was one of the \n","big folk from foreign parts. he spoke funny. \n","\n","'i couldn't stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and i \n","didn't give much heed to it myself. the gaffer is getting old, and more than \n","a bit blind, and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the \n","hill and found him taking the air at the end of our row. i hope he hasn't \n","done no harm, sir, nor me.' \n","\n","'the gaffer can't be blamed anyway,' said frodo. 'as a matter of fact i \n","heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inquiring for me, and i \n","nearly went and asked him who it was. i wish i had, or you had told me about \n","it before. i might have been more careful on the road.' \n","\n","'still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the gaffer's \n","stranger,' said pippin. 'we left hobbiton secretly enough, and i don't see \n","how he could have followed us.' \n","\n","'what about the smelling, sir?' said sam. 'and the gaffer said he was a \n","black chap.' \n","\n","'i wish i had waited for gandalf,' frodo muttered. 'but perhaps it \n","would only have made matters worse.' \n","\n","'then you know or guess something about this rider?' said pippin, who \n","had caught the muttered words. \n","\n","'i don't know, and i would rather not guess,' said frodo. 'all right, \n","cousin frodo! you can keep your secret for the present, if you want to be \n","mysterious. in the meanwhile what are we to do? i should like a bite and a \n","sup, but somehow i think we had better move on from here. your talk of \n","sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.' \n","\n","'yes, i think we will move on now,' said frodo; 'but not on the road \n","-in case that rider comes back, or another follows him. we ought to do a \n","good step more today. buckland is still miles away.' \n","\n","the shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they \n","started off again. they now kept a stone's throw to the left of the road, \n","and kept out of sight of it as much as they could. but this hindered them; \n","for the grass was thick and tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the trees \n","began to draw together into thickets. \n","\n","the sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, and evening \n","was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","over which it had run straight for some miles. at that point it bent left \n","and went down into the lowlands of the yale making for stock; but a lane \n","branched right, winding through a wood of ancient oak-trees on its way to \n","woodhall. 'that is the way for us,' said frodo. \n","\n","not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it \n","was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out \n","round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and \n","could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road. the \n","hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed \n","wood. they rested and had a light meal, talking quietly and listening from \n","time to time. \n","\n","twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane. the west wind \n","was sighing in the branches. leaves were whispering. soon the road began to \n","fall gently but steadily into the dusk. a star came out above the trees in \n","the darkening east before them. they went abreast and in step, to keep up \n","their spirits. after a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the \n","feeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened for the sound of \n","hoofs. they began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk \n","along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. with most \n","hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a \n","walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). \n","bilbo baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, \n","and taught it to frodo as they walked in the lanes of the water -valley and \n","talked about adventure. \n","\n","upon the hearth the fire is red, \n","\n","beneath the roof there is a bed; \n","\n","but not yet weary are our feet, \n","\n","still round the corner we may meet \n","a sudden tree or standing stone \n","that none have seen but we alone. \n","\n","tree and flower and leaf and grass, \n","\n","let them pass! let them pass! \n","\n","hill and water under sky, \n","\n","pass them by! pass them by! \n","\n","\n","\n","still round the corner there may wait \n","a new road or a secret gate, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and though we pass them by today, \n","\n","tomorrow we may come this way \n","and take the hidden paths that run \n","towards the moon or to the sun. \n","\n","apple, thorn, and nut and sloe, \n","\n","let them go! let them go! \n","\n","sand and stone and pool and dell, \n","\n","fare you well! fare you well! \n","\n","home is behind, the world ahead, \n","\n","and there are many paths to tread \n","through shadows to the edge of night, \n","\n","until the stars are all alight. \n","\n","then world behind and home ahead, \n","\n","we'll wander back to home and bed. \n","\n","mist and twilight, cloud and shade, \n","\n","away shall fade! away shall fade! \n","\n","fire and lamp, and meat and bread, \n","\n","and then to bed! and then to bed! \n","\n","the song ended. 'and now to bed! and now to bed!' sang pippin in a high \n","voice. \n","\n","'hush!' said frodo. 'i think i hear hoofs again.' \n","\n","they slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. \n","\n","there was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and \n","clear down the wind. quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran \n","into the deeper shade under the oak-trees. \n","\n","'don't let us go too far!' said frodo. 'i don't want to be seen, but i \n","want to see if it is another black rider.' \n","\n","'very well!' said pippin. 'but don't forget the sniffing!' \n","\n","the hoofs drew nearer. they had no time to find any hiding-place better \n","than the general darkness under the trees; sam and pippin crouched behind a \n","large tree-bole, while frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane. it \n","showed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood. above it the \n","stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon. \n","\n","the sound of hoofs stopped. as frodo watched he saw something dark pass \n","across the lighter space between two trees, and then halt. it looked like \n","the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow. the black shadow \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","stood close to the point where they had left the path, and it swayed from \n","side to side. frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling. the shadow bent \n","to the ground, and then began to crawl towards him. \n","\n","once more the desire to slip on the ring came over frodo; but this time \n","it was stronger than before. so strong that, almost before he realized what \n","he was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket. but at that moment there \n","came a sound like mingled song and laughter. clear voices rose and fell in \n","the starlit air. the black shadow straightened up and retreated. it climbed \n","on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the \n","darkness on the other side. frodo breathed again. \n","\n","'elves!' exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper. 'elves, sir!' he would have \n","burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if they had not \n","pulled him back. \n","\n","'yes, it is elves,' said frodo. 'one can meet them sometimes in the \n","woody end. they don't live in the shire, but they wander into it in spring \n","and autumn, out of their own lands away beyond the tower hills. i am \n","thankful that they do! you did not see, but that black rider stopped just \n","here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. as soon as he \n","heard the voices he slipped away.' \n","\n","'what about the elves?' said sam, too excited to trouble about the \n","rider. 'can't we go and see them?' \n","\n","'listen! they are coming this way,' said frodo. 'we have only to wait.' \n","\n","the singing drew nearer. one clear voice rose now above the others. it was \n","singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which frodo knew only a little, and the \n","others knew nothing. yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape \n","itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood. this \n","was the song as frodo heard it: \n","\n","\n","\n","snow-white! snow-white! o lady clear! \n","o queen beyond the western seas! \n","\n","o light to us that wander here \n","\n","\n","\n","amid the world of woven trees! \n","\n","\n","\n","gilthoniel! o elbereth! \n","\n","clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath! \n","snow-white! snow-white! we sing to thee \n","in a far land beyond the sea. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","o stars that in the sunless year \n","\n","with shining hand by her were sawn, \n","\n","in windy fields now bright and clear \n","\n","we see your silver blossom blown! \n","\n","o elbereth! gilthoniel! \n","\n","we still remember, we who dwell \n","\n","in this far land beneath the trees, \n","\n","thy starlight on the western seas. \n","\n","the song ended. these are high elves! they spoke the name of \n","elbereth!' said frodo in amazement, 'few of that fairest folk are ever seen \n","in the shire. not many now remain in middle-earth, east of the great sea. \n","this is indeed a strange chance!' \n","\n","the hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. before long the elves came \n","down the lane towards the valley. they passed slowly, and the hobbits could \n","see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes. they bore no \n","lights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like the light of the moon above the \n","rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. they were \n","now silent, and as the last elf passed he turned and looked towards the \n","hobbits and laughed. \n","\n","'hail, frodo!' he cried. 'you are abroad late. or are you perhaps \n","lost?' then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stopped and \n","gathered round. \n","\n","'this is indeed wonderful!' they said. 'three hobbits in a wood at \n","night! we have not seen such a thing since bilbo went away. what is the \n","meaning of it?' \n","\n","'the meaning of it, fair people,' said frodo, 'is simply that we seem \n","to be going the same way as you are. i like walking under the stars. but i \n","would welcome your company.' \n","\n","'but we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,' they \n","laughed. 'and how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do \n","not \n","\n","know whither we are going?' \n","\n","'and how do you know my name?' asked frodo in return. \n","\n","'we know many things,' they said. 'we have seen you often before with \n","bilbo, though you may not have seen us.' \n","\n","'who are you, and who is your lord?' asked frodo. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'i am gildor,' answered their leader, the elf who had first hailed him. \n","\n","'gildor inglorion of the house of finrod. we are exiles, and most of our \n","kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a \n","while, ere we return over the great sea. but some of our kinsfolk dwell \n","still in peace in rivendell. come now, frodo, tell us what you are doing? \n","\n","for we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you.' \n","\n","'o wise people!' interrupted pippin eagerly. 'tell us about the black \n","riders!' \n","\n","'black riders?' they said in low voices. 'why do you ask about black \n","riders?' \n","\n","'because two black riders have overtaken us today, or one has done so \n","twice,' said pippin; 'only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew \n","near.' \n","\n","the elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in their \n","own tongue. at length gildor turned to the hobbits. 'we will not speak of \n","this here,' he said. 'we think you had best come now with us. it is not our \n","custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and you shall lodge \n","with us tonight, if you will.' \n","\n","'o fair folk! this is good fortune beyond my hope,' said pippin. sam \n","was speechless. 'i thank you indeed, gildor inglorion,' said frodo bowing. \n","'elen snla lmenn' omentielvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,' he \n","added in the high-elven speech. \n","\n","'be careful, friends!' cried gildor laughing. 'speak no secrets! here \n","is a scholar in the ancient tongue. bilbo was a good master. hail, \n","elf-friend!' he said, bowing to frodo. 'come now with your friends and join \n","our company! you had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray. you \n","may be weary before we halt.' \n","\n","'why? where are you going?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'for tonight we go to the woods on the hills above woodhall. it is some \n","miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will shorten your \n","journey tomorrow.' \n","\n","they now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint \n","lights: for elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished \n","without sound or footfall. pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered \n","once or twice; but each time a tall elf at his side put out his arm and \n","saved him from a fall. sam walked along at frodo's side, as if in a dream, \n","with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and \n","thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, \n","there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. at \n","last the elves turned aside from the path. a green ride lay almost unseen \n","through the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away \n","back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that \n","stood out into the lower land of the river -valley. suddenly they came out of \n","the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of grass, grey \n","under the night. on three sides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the \n","ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of \n","the slope, were below their feet. beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat \n","under the stars. nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of \n","woodhall. \n","\n","the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they \n","seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits. frodo and his companions \n","wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them. \n","the night grew on, and the lights in the valley went out. pippin fell \n","asleep, pillowed on a green hillock. \n","\n","away high in the east swung remmirath, the netted stars, and slowly \n","above the mists red borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. then by some \n","shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up, \n","as he climbed over the rim of the world, the swordsman of the sky, \n","menelvagor with his shining belt. the elves all burst into song. suddenly \n","under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light. \n","\n","'come!' the elves called to the hobbits. 'come! now is the time for \n","speech and merriment!' \n","\n","pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. he shivered. 'there is a fire in the \n","hall, and food for hungry guests,' said an elf standing before him. \n","\n","at the south end of the greensward there was an opening. there the \n","green floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space like a hall, \n","roofed by the boughs of trees. their great trunks ran like pillars down each \n","side. in the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars \n","torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily. the elves sat \n","round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks. some \n","went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink; others brought food on \n","heaped plates and dishes. \n","\n","'this is poor fare,' they said to the hobbits; 'for we are lodging in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the greenwood far from our halls. if ever you are our guests at home, we \n","will treat you better.' \n","\n","'it seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said frodo. \n","\n","pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind \n","was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so \n","various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. but he remembered \n","that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who \n","is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended \n","fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, \n","cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon. \n","\n","sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what \n","he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory as one of \n","the chief events of his life. the nearest he ever got was to say: 'well, \n","sir, if i could grow apples like that, i would call myself a gardener. but \n","it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what i mean.' \n","\n","frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was \n","chiefly on the words spoken. he knew a little of the elf-speech and listened \n","eagerly. now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in \n","their own language. they smiled at him and said laughing: 'here is a jewel \n","among hobbits!' \n","\n","after a while pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away \n","to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the \n","rest of the night away. sam refused to leave his master. when pippin had \n","gone, he came and sat curled up at frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and \n","closed his eyes. frodo remained long awake, talking with gildor. \n","\n","they spoke of many things, old and new, and frodo questioned gildor \n","much about happenings in the wide world outside the shire. the tidings were \n","mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of men, and the \n","flight of the elves. at last frodo asked the question that was nearest to \n","his heart: \n","\n","'tell me, gildor, have you ever seen bilbo since he left us?' \n","\n","gildor smiled. 'yes,' he answered. 'twice. he said farewell to us on \n","this very spot. but i saw him once again, far from here.' he would say no \n","more about bilbo, and frodo fell silent. \n","\n","'you do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, frodo,' said \n","gildor. 'but i already know a little, and i can read more in your face and \n","in the thought behind your questions. you are leaving the shire, and yet you \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or \n","that you will ever return. is not that so?' \n","\n","'it is,' said frodo; 'but i thought my going was a secret known only to \n","gandalf and my faithful sam.' he looked down at sam, who was snoring \n","gently. \n","\n","'the secret will not reach the enemy from us,' said gildor. \n","\n","'the enemy?' said frodo. 'then you know why i am leaving the shire?' \n","\n","'i do not know for what reason the enemy is pursuing you,' answered \n","gildor; 'but i perceive that he is - strange indeed though that seems to me. \n","\n","and i warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon \n","either side.' \n","\n","'you mean the riders? i feared that they were servants of the enemy. \n","what are the black riders?' \n","\n","'has gandalf told you nothing?' \n","\n","'nothing about such creatures.' \n","\n","'then i think it is not for me to say more - lest terror should keep \n","you from your journey. for it seems to me that you have set out only just in \n","time, if indeed you are in time. you must now make haste, and neither stay \n","nor turn back; for the shire is no longer any protection to you.' \n","\n","'i cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your \n","hints and warnings,' exclaimed frodo. 'i knew that danger lay ahead, of \n","course; but i did not expect to meet it in our own shire. can't a hobbit \n","walk from the water to the river in peace?' \n","\n","'but it is not your own shire,' said gildor. 'others dwelt here before \n","hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. the \n","wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for \n","ever fence it out.' \n","\n","'i know - and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. what can i \n","do now? my plan was to leave the shire secretly, and make my way to \n","rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever i get to buckland.' \n","\n","'i think you should still follow that plan,' said gildor. 'i do not \n","think the road will prove too hard for your courage. but if you desire \n","clearer counsel, you should ask gandalf. i do not know the reason for your \n","flight, and therefore i do not know by what means your pursuers will assail \n","you. these things gandalf must know. i suppose that you will see him before \n","you leave the shire?' \n","\n","'i hope so. but that is another thing that makes me anxious. i have \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","been expecting gandalf for many days. he was to have come to hobbiton at \n","the \n","\n","latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared. now i am wondering what \n","can have happened. should i wait for him?' \n","\n","gildor was silent for a moment. 'i do not like this news,' he said at \n","last. 'that gandalf should be late, does not bode well. but it is said: do \n","not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to \n","anger. the choice is yours: to go or wait.' \n","\n","'and it is also said,' answered frodo: 'go not to the elves for \n","counsel, for they will say both no and yes. ' \n","\n","'is it indeed?' laughed gildor. 'elves seldom give unguarded advice, \n","for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all \n","courses may run ill. but what would you? you have not told me all concerning \n","yourself; and how then shall i choose better than you? but if you demand \n","advice, i will for friendship's sake give it. i think you should now go at \n","once, without delay; and if gandalf does not come before you set out, then i \n","also advise this: do not go alone. take such friends as are trusty and \n","willing. now you should be grateful, for i do not give this counsel gladly. \n","\n","the elves have their own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little \n","concerned with the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. \n","\n","our paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. in this meeting there \n","may be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and i fear to \n","say too much.' \n","\n","'i am deeply grateful,' said frodo; 'but i wish you would tell me \n","plainly what the black riders are. if i take your advice i may not see \n","gandalf for a long while, and i ought to know what is the danger that \n","pursues me.' \n","\n","'is it not enough to know that they are servants of the enemy?' \n","answered gildor. 'flee them! speak no words to them! they are deadly. ask no \n","more of me! but my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, frodo son of \n","drogo, will know more of these fell things than gildor inglorion. may \n","elbereth protect you!' \n","\n","'but where shall i find courage?' asked frodo. 'that is what i chiefly \n","need.' \n","\n","'courage is found in unlikely places,' said gildor. 'be of good hope! \n","\n","sleep now! in the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our messages \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","through the lands. the wandering companies shall know of your journey, \n","and \n","\n","those that have power for good shall be on the watch. i name you elf-friend; \n","and may the stars shine upon the end of your road! seldom have we had such \n","delight in strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the ancient speech \n","from the lips of other wanderers in the world.' \n","\n","frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as gildor finished speaking. 'i \n","will sleep now,' he said; and the elf led him to a bower beside pippin, and \n","he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 4 . a short cut to mushrooms \n","\n","\n","\n","in the morning frodo woke refreshed. he was lying in a bower made by a \n","living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of \n","fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. the sun was shining \n","through the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon the tree. he \n","jumped up and went out. \n","\n","sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. pippin was \n","standing studying the sky and weather. there was no sign of the elves. \n","\n","'they have left us fruit and drink, and bread,' said pippin. 'come and \n","have your breakfast. the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. i \n","did not want to leave you any, but sam insisted.' \n","\n","frodo sat down beside sam and began to eat. 'what is the plan for \n","today?' asked pippin. \n","\n","'to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible,' answered frodo, and \n","gave his attention to the food. \n","\n","'do you think we shall see anything of those riders?' asked pippin \n","cheerfully. under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of \n","them did not seem very alarming to him. \n","\n","'yes, probably,' said frodo, not liking the reminder. 'but i hope to \n","get across the river without their seeing us.' \n","\n","'did you find out anything about them from gildor?' \n","\n","'not much - only hints and riddles,' said frodo evasively. 'did you ask \n","about the sniffing?' \n","\n","'we didn't discuss it,' said frodo with his mouth full. \n","\n","'you should have. i am sure it is very important.' \n","\n","'in that case i am sure gildor would have refused to explain it,' said \n","frodo sharply. 'and now leave me in peace for a bit! i don't want to answer \n","a string of questions while i am eating. i want to think!' \n","\n","'good heavens!' said pippin. 'at breakfast?' he walked away towards the \n","edge of the green. \n","\n","from frodo' s mind the bright morning - treacherously bright, he thought \n","- had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of gildor. \n","the merry voice of pippin came to him. he was running on the green turf and \n","singing. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'no! i could not!' he said to himself. 'it is one thing to take my \n","young friends walking over the shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, \n","and food and bed are sweet. to take them into exile, where hunger and \n","weariness may have no cure, is quite another - even if they are willing to \n","come. the inheritance is mine alone. i don't think i ought even to take \n","sam.' he looked at sam gamgee, and discovered that sam was watching him. \n","\n","'well, sam!' he said. 'what about it? i am leaving the shire as soon as \n","ever i can - in fact i have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at \n","crickhollow, if it can be helped.' \n","\n","'very good, sir!' \n","\n","'you still mean to come with me?' \n","\n","'i do.' \n","\n","'it is going to be very dangerous, sam. 'it is already dangerous. most \n","likely neither of us will come back.' \n","\n","'if you don't come back, sir, then i shan't, that's certain,' said sam. \n","\n","'don't you leave him! they said to me. leave him! i said. i never mean to. i \n","am going with him, if he climbs to the moon, and if any of those black \n","rulers try to stop him, they'll have sam gamgee to reckon with, i said. they \n","laughed.' \n","\n","'who are they, and what are you talking about?' \n","\n","'the elves, sir. we had some talk last night; and they seemed to know \n","you were going away, so i didn't see the use of denying it. wonderful folk, \n","elves, sir! wonderful!' \n","\n","'they are,' said frodo. 'do you like them still, now you have had a \n","closer view?' \n","\n","'they seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,' answered \n","sam slowly. 'it don't seem to matter what i think about them. they are quite \n","different from what i expected - so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it \n","were.' \n","\n","frodo looked at sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward \n","sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. it did not sound \n","like the voice of the old sam gamgee that he thought he knew. but it looked \n","like the old sam gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually \n","thoughtful. \n","\n","'do you feel any need to leave the shire now - now that your wish to \n","see them has come true already?' he asked. \n","\n","'yes, sir. i don't know how to say it, but after last night i feel \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","different. i seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. i know we are going to \n","take a very long road, into darkness; but i know i can't turn back. it isn't \n","to see elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that i want - 1 don't rightly \n","know what i want: but i have something to do before the end, and it lies \n","ahead, not in the shire. i must see it through, sir, if you understand me.' \n","\n","'i don't altogether. but i understand that gandalf chose me a good \n","companion. i am content. we will go together.' \n","\n","frodo finished his breakfast in silence. then standing up he looked \n","over the land ahead, and called to pippin. \n","\n","'all ready to start?' he said as pippin ran up. 'we must be getting off \n","at once. we slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.' \n","\n","'you slept late, you mean,' said pippin. 'i was up long before; and we \n","are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.' \n","\n","'i have finished both now. and i am going to make for bucklebury ferry \n","as quickly as possible. i am not going out of the way, back to the road we \n","left last night: i am going to cut straight across country from here.' \n","\n","'then you are going to fly,' said pippin. 'you won't cut straight on \n","foot anywhere in this country.' \n","\n","'we can cut straighter than the road anyway,' answered frodo. 'the \n","ferry is east from woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left -you \n","can see a bend of it away north over there. it goes round the north end of \n","the marish so as to strike the causeway from the bridge above stock. but \n","that is miles out of the way. we could save a quarter of the distance if we \n","made a line for the ferry from where we stand.' \n","\n","'short cuts make long delays, ' argued pippin. 'the country is rough \n","round here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the \n","marish -i know the land in these parts. and if you are worrying about black \n","riders, i can't see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a \n","wood or a field.' \n","\n","'it is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,' answered \n","frodo. 'and if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that \n","you will be looked for on the road and not off it.' \n","\n","'all right!' said pippin. 'i will follow you into every bog and ditch. \n","\n","but it is hard! i had counted on passing the golden perch at stock before \n","sundown. the best beer in the eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time \n","since i tasted it.' \n","\n","'that settles it!' said frodo. 'short cuts make delays, but inns make \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","longer ones. at all costs we must keep you away from the golden perch. we \n","want to get to bucklebury before dark. what do you say, sam?' \n","\n","'i will go along with you, mr. frodo,' said sam (in spite of private \n","misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing). \n","\n","then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let's go now!' \n","said pippin. \n","\n","it was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds \n","were beginning to come up from the west. it looked likely to turn to rain. \n","\n","the hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick \n","trees below. their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their left, \n","and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side \n","of the hills, until they reached the flats beyond. then they could make \n","straight for the ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches \n","and fences. frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line. \n","\n","he soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had \n","appeared. there were no paths in the undergrowth, and they did not get on \n","very fast. when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a \n","stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep \n","slippery sides overhung with brambles. most inconveniently it cut across the \n","line they had chosen. they could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it \n","at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. they halted, wondering \n","what to do. 'first check!' said pippin, smiling grimly. \n","\n","sam gamgee looked back. through an opening in the trees he caught a \n","glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down. \n","\n","'look!' he said, clutching frodo by the arm. they all looked, and on \n","the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing. beside \n","it stooped a black figure. \n","\n","they at once gave up any idea of going back. frodo led the way, and \n","plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream. 'whew!' he said to \n","pippin. 'we were both right! the short cut has gone crooked already; but we \n","got under cover only just in time. you've got sharp ears, sam: can you hear \n","anything coming?' \n","\n","they stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but \n","there was no sound of pursuit. 'i don't fancy he would try bringing his \n","horse down that bank,' said sam. 'but i guess he knows we came down it. we \n","had better be going on.' \n","\n","going on was not altogether easy. they had packs to carry, and the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. they were cut off \n","from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. when \n","they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired \n","and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in \n","which they were going. the banks of the stream sank, as it reached the \n","levels and became broader and shallower, wandering off towards the marish \n","and the river. \n","\n","'why, this is the stock-brook!' said pippin. 'if we are going to try \n","and get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear right.' \n","\n","they waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown \n","and treeless, on the further side. beyond that they came again to a belt of \n","trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an \n","ash. the ground was fairly level, and there was little undergrowth; but the \n","trees were loo close for them to see far ahead. the leaves blew upwards in \n","sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. \n","then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down. they trudged \n","along \n","\n","as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of \n","old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. they did not \n","talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side. \n","\n","after half an hour pippin said: 'i hope we have not turned too much \n","towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! it is not \n","a very broad belt -i should have said no more than a mile at the widest - \n","and we ought to have been through it by now.' \n","\n","'it is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said frodo. 'that won't \n","mend matters. let us keep on as we are going! i am not sure that i want to \n","come out into the open yet.' \n","\n","they went on for perhaps another couple of miles. then the sun gleamed \n","out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. it was now past mid-day, \n","and they felt it was high time for lunch. they halted under an elm tree: its \n","leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at its \n","feel was fairly dry and sheltered. when they came to make their meal, they \n","found that the elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale \n","golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers, and was \n","wonderfully refreshing. very soon they were laughing, and snapping their \n","fingers at rain, and at black riders. the last few miles, they felt, would \n","soon be behind them. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. sam \n","and pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly: \n","\n","ho! ho! ho! to the bottle i go \n","\n","to heal my heart and drown my woe. \n","\n","rain may fall and wind may blow, \n","\n","and many miles be still to go, \n","\n","but under a tall tree i will lie, \n","\n","and let the clouds go sailing by. \n","\n","ho! ho! ho! they began again louder. they stopped short suddenly. frodo \n","sprang to his feet. a long-drawn wail came down the wind, like the cry of \n","some evil and lonely creature. it rose and fell, and ended on a high \n","piercing note. even as they sat and stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was \n","answered by another cry, fainter and further off, but no less chilling to \n","the blood. there was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in \n","the leaves. \n","\n","'and what do you think that was?' pippin asked at last, trying to speak \n","lightly, but quavering a little. 'if it was a bird, it was one that i never \n","heard in the shire before.' \n","\n","'it was not bird or beast,' said frodo. 'it was a call, or a signal - \n","there were words in that cry, though i could not catch them. but no hobbit \n","has such a voice.' \n","\n","no more was said about it. they were all thinking of the riders, but no \n","one spoke of them. they were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but \n","sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the ferry, \n","and it was best to go sooner and in daylight. in a few moments they had \n","shouldered their packs again and were off. \n","\n","before long the wood came to a sudden end. wide grass-lands stretched \n","before them. they now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the \n","south. away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of bucklebury \n","across the river, but it was now to their left. creeping cautiously out from \n","the edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they \n","could. \n","\n","at first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. far back \n","behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted. frodo half \n","expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark \n","against the sky; but there was no sign of one. the sun escaping from the \n","breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","brightly again. their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. but the \n","land became steadily more tame and well-ordered. soon they came into \n","well-tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for \n","drainage. everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of \n","the shire. their spirits rose with every step. the line of the river grew \n","nearer; and the black riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now \n","left far behind. \n","\n","they passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout \n","gate. beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a \n","distant clump of trees. pippin stopped. \n","\n","'i know these fields and this gate!' he said. 'this is bamfurlong, old \n","farmer maggot's land. that's his farm away there in the trees.' \n","\n","'one trouble after another!' said frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed \n","as if pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon's den. \n","\n","the others looked at him in surprise. \n","\n","'what's wrong with old maggot?' asked pippin. 'he's a good friend to \n","all the brandy bucks. of course he's a terror to trespassers, and keeps \n","ferocious dogs - but after all, folk down here are near the border and have \n","to be more on their guard.' \n","\n","'i know,' said frodo. 'but all the same,' he added with a shamefaced \n","laugh, 'i am terrified of him and his dogs. i have avoided his farm for \n","years and years. he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, \n","when i was a youngster at brandy hall. on the last occasion he beat me, and \n","then took me and showed me to his dogs. \"see, lads,\" he said, \"next time \n","this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat him. now see him off!\" \n","they chased me all the way to the ferry. i have never got over the fright - \n","though i daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have \n","touched me.' \n","\n","pippin laughed. 'well, it's time you made it up. especially if you are \n","coming back to live in buckland. old maggot is really a stout fellow - if \n","you leave his mushrooms alone. fet's get into the lane and then we shan't be \n","trespassing. if we meet him, i'll do the talking. he is a friend of merry's, \n","and i used to come here with him a good deal at one time.' \n","\n","they went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large \n","house and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead. the maggots, \n","and \n","\n","the puddifoots of stock, and most of the inhabitants of the marish, were \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall \n","all round it. there was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the \n","lane. \n","\n","suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out, \n","and a loud voice was heard shouting: 'grip! fang! wolf! come on, lads!' \n","\n","frodo and sam stopped dead, but pippin walked on a few paces. the gate \n","opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed \n","towards the travellers, barking fiercely. they took no notice of pippin; but \n","sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him \n","suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. the largest and most ferocious of the \n","three halted in front of frodo, bristling and growling. \n","\n","through the gate there now appeared a broad thick -set hobbit with a \n","round red face. 'hallo! hallo! and who may you be, and what may you be \n","wanting?' he asked. \n","\n","'good afternoon, mr. maggot!' said pippin. \n","\n","the farmer looked at him closely. 'well, if it isn't master pippin - \n","mr. peregrin took, i should say!' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin. \n","'it's a long time since i saw you round here. it's lucky for you that i know \n","you. i was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers. there are some \n","funny things going on today. of course, we do get queer folk wandering in \n","these parts at times. too near the river,' he said, shaking his head. 'but \n","this fellow was the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on. he won't cross \n","my land without leave a second time, not if i can stop it.' \n","\n","'what fellow do you mean?' asked pippin. \n","\n","'then you haven't seen him?' said the farmer. 'he went up the lane \n","towards the causeway not a long while back. he was a funny customer and \n","asking funny questions. but perhaps you'll come along inside, and we'll pass \n","the news more comfortable. i've a drop of good ale on tap, if you and your \n","friends are willing, mr. took.' \n","\n","it seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do \n","it in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation. 'what \n","about the dogs?' asked frodo anxiously. \n","\n","the farmer laughed. 'they won't harm you - not unless i tell 'em to. \n","\n","here, grip! fang! heel!' he cried. 'heel, wolf!' to the relief of frodo and \n","sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free. \n","\n","pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. 'mr. frodo baggins,' he \n","said. 'you may not remember him, but he used to live at brandy hall.' at the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","name baggins the farmer started, and gave frodo a sharp glance. for a moment \n","frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and \n","that \n","\n","the dogs would be told to see him off. but farmer maggot took him by the \n","arm. \n","\n","'well, if that isn't queerer than ever?' he exclaimed. 'mr. baggins is \n","it? come inside! we must have a talk.' \n","\n","they went into the farmer's kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. \n","\n","mrs. maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. it \n","was a good brew, and pippin found himself more than compensated for \n","missing \n","\n","the golden perch. sam sipped his beer suspiciously. he had a natural \n","mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the shire; and also he was not \n","disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however \n","long ago. \n","\n","after a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects \n","(which were no worse than usual), farmer maggot put down his mug and \n","looked \n","\n","at them all in turn. \n","\n","'now, mr. peregrin,' he said, 'where might you be coming from, and \n","where might you be going to? were you coming to visit' me? for, if so, you \n","had gone past my gate without my seeing you.' \n","\n","'well, no,' answered pippin. 'to tell you the truth, since you have \n","guessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your \n","fields. but that was quite by accident. we lost our way in the woods, back \n","near woodhall, trying to take a short cut to the ferry.' \n","\n","'if you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,' said \n","the farmer. 'but i wasn't worrying about that. you have leave to walk over \n","my land, if you have a mind, mr. peregrin. and you, mr. baggins - though i \n","daresay you still like mushrooms.' he laughed. 'ah yes, i recognized the \n","name. i recollect the time when young frodo baggins was one of the worst \n","young rascals of buckland. but it wasn't mushrooms i was thinking of. i had \n","just heard the name baggins before you turned up. what do you think that \n","funny customer asked me?' \n","\n","they waited anxiously for him to go on. 'well,' the farmer continued, \n","approaching his point with slow relish, 'he came riding on a big black horse \n","in at the gate, which happened to be open, and right up to my door. all \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want \n","to be known. \"now what in the shire can he want?\" i thought to myself. we \n","don't see many of the big folk over the border; and anyway i had never heard \n","of any like this black fellow. \n","\n","' \"good-day to you!\" i says, going out to him. \"this lane don't lead \n","anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back to \n","the road.\" i didn't like the looks of him; and when grip came out, he took \n","one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail \n","and bolted off howling. the black fellow sat quite still. \n","\n","' \"i come from yonder,\" he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back \n","west, over my fields, if you please. \"have you seen baggins? \" he asked in a \n","queer voice, and bent down towards me. i could not see any face, for his \n","hood fell down so low; and i felt a sort of shiver down my back. but i did \n","not see why he should come riding over my land so bold. \n","\n","' \"be off!\" i said. \"there are no bagginses here. you're in the wrong \n","part of the shire. you had better go back west to hobbiton - but you can go \n","by road this time.\" \n","\n","' \"baggins has left,\" he answered in a whisper. \"he is coming. he is \n","not far away. i wish to find him. if he passes will you tell me? i will come \n","back with gold.\" \n","\n","' \"no you won't,\" i said. \"you'll go back where you belong, double \n","quick. i give you one minute before i call all my dogs.\" \n","\n","'he gave a sort of hiss. it might have been laughing, and it might not. \n","\n","then he spurred his great horse right at me, and i jumped out of the way \n","only just in time. i called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the \n","gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder. what do \n","you think of that?' \n","\n","frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was \n","how on earth would they reach the ferry. 'i don't know what to think,' he \n","said at last. \n","\n","'then i'll tell you what to think,' said maggot. 'you should never have \n","gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton folk, mr. frodo. folk are queer up \n","there.' sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer with an \n","unfriendly eye. 'but you were always a reckless lad. when i heard you had \n","left the brandybucks and gone off to that old mr. bilbo, i said that you \n","were going to find trouble. mark my words, this all comes of those strange \n","doings of mr. bilbo's. his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","parts, they say. maybe there is some that want to know what has become of \n","the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of hobbiton, as i hear?' \n","\n","frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather \n","disconcerting. \n","\n","'well, mr. frodo,' maggot went on, 'i'm glad that you've had the sense \n","to come back to buckland. my advice is: stay there! and don't get mixed up \n","with these outlandish folk. you'll have friends in these parts. if any of \n","these black fellows come after you again, i'll deal with them. i'll say \n","you're dead, or have left the shire, or anything you like. and that might be \n","true enough; for as like as not it is old mr. bilbo they want news of.' \n","\n","'maybe you're right,' said frodo, avoiding the farmer's eye and staring \n","at the fire. \n","\n","maggot looked at him thoughtfully. 'well, i see you have ideas of your \n","own,' he said. 'it is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and \n","that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my news was no great news \n","to you, after all. i am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind \n","to keep to yourself; but i see you are in some kind of trouble. perhaps you \n","are thinking it won't be too easy to get to the ferry without being caught?' \n","\n","'i was thinking so,' said frodo. but we have got to try and get there; \n","and it won't be done by sitting and thinking. sol am afraid we must be \n","going. thank you very much indeed for your kindness! i've been in terror of \n","you and your dogs for over thirty years, farmer maggot, though you may laugh \n","to hear it. it's a pity: for i've missed a good friend. and now i'm sorry to \n","leave so soon. but i'll come back, perhaps, one day - if i get a chance.' \n","\n","'you'll be welcome when you come,' said maggot. 'but now i've a notion. \n","it's near sundown already, and we are going to have our supper; for we \n","mostly go to bed soon after the sun. if you and mr. peregrin and all could \n","stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!' \n","\n","'and so should we!' said frodo. 'but we must be going at once, i'm \n","afraid. even now it will be dark before we can reach the ferry.' \n","\n","'ah! but wait a minute! i was going to say: after a bit of supper, i'll \n","gel out a small waggon, and i'll drive you all to the ferry. that will save \n","you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.' \n","\n","frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of pippin \n","and sam. the sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was \n","failing. two of maggot's sons and his three daughters came in, and a \n","generous supper was laid on the large table. the kitchen was lit with \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","candles and the fire was mended. mrs. maggot hustled in and out. one or two \n","other hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. in a short while \n","fourteen sat down to eat. there was beer in plenty, and a mighty dish of \n","mushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. the dogs lay \n","by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones. \n","\n","when they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern \n","and got the waggon ready. it was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. \n","they threw their packs on board and climbed in. the farmer sat in the \n","driving-seat, and whipped up his two stout ponies. his wife stood in the \n","light of the open door. \n","\n","'you be careful of yourself. maggot!' she called. 'don't go arguing \n","with any foreigners, and come straight back!' \n","\n","'i will!' said he, and drove out of the gate. there was now no breath \n","of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. \n","\n","they went without lights and took it slowly. after a mile or two the lane \n","came to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to \n","the high-banked causeway. \n","\n","maggot got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but \n","nothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was not a sound in the \n","still air. thin strands of river -mist were hanging above the dikes, and \n","crawling over the fields. \n","\n","'it's going to be thick,' said maggot; 'but i'll not light my lantern \n","till i turn for home. we'll hear anything on the road long before we meet it \n","tonight.' \n","\n","it was five miles or more from maggot's lane to the ferry. the hobbits \n","wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the \n","creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies' hoofs. the waggon \n","seemed slower than a snail to frodo. beside him pippin was nodding towards \n","sleep; but sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. \n","\n","they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last. it was marked by \n","two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right. farmer maggot \n","drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. they were just \n","beginning lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what they had all been \n","dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. the sound was coming towards them. \n","\n","maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies' heads, and peering \n","forward into the gloom. clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. the \n","fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'you'd better be hidden, mr. frodo,' said sam anxiously. 'you get down \n","in the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we'll send this rider to the \n","rightabouts!' he climbed out and went to the farmer's side. black riders \n","would have to ride over him to get near the waggon. \n","\n","clop-clop, clop-clop. the rider was nearly on them. \n","\n","'hallo there!' called farmer maggot. the advancing hoofs stopped short. \n","they thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard \n","or two ahead. 'now then!' said the farmer, throwing the reins to sam and \n","striding forward. 'don't you come a step nearer! what do you want, and where \n","are you going?' \n","\n","'i want mr. baggins. have you seen him?' said a muffled voice - but the \n","voice was the voice of merry brandybuck. a dark lantern was uncovered, and \n","its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer. \n","\n","'mr. merry!' he cried. \n","\n","'yes, of course! who did you think it was?' said merry coming forward. \n","\n","as he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly to \n","diminish to ordinary hobbit-size. he was riding a pony, and a scarf was \n","swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog. \n","\n","frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. 'so there you are at \n","last!' said merry. 'i was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all \n","today, and i was just going back to supper. when it grew foggy i came across \n","and rode up towards stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches. but i'm \n","blest if i know which way you have come. where did you find them, mr. \n","maggot? in your duck-pond?' \n","\n","'no, i caught 'em trespassing,' said the farmer, 'and nearly set my \n","dogs on 'em; but they'll tell you all the story, i've no doubt. now, if \n","you'll excuse me, mr. merry and mr. frodo and all, i'd best be turning for \n","home. mrs. maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.' \n","\n","he backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. 'well, good night to \n","you all,' he said. 'it's been a queer day, and no mistake. but all's well as \n","ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own \n","doors. i'll not deny that i'll be glad now when i do.' he lit his lanterns, \n","and got up. suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. 'i was \n","nearly forgetting,' he said. 'mrs. maggot put this up for mr. baggins, with \n","her compliments.' he handed it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of \n","thanks and good-nights. \n","\n","they watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","dwindled into the foggy night. suddenly frodo laughed: from the covered \n","basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 5 . a conspiracy unmasked \n","\n","\n","\n","'now we had better get home ourselves,' said merry. there's something \n","funny about all this, i see; but it must wait till we get in.' \n","\n","they turned down the ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and \n","edged with large white- washed stones. in a hundred yards or so it brought \n","them to the river -bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. a \n","large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. the white bollards near the \n","water's edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. behind them \n","the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before \n","them was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by \n","the bank. there seemed to be less fog on the further side. \n","\n","merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others \n","followed. merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. the brandywine \n","flowed slow and broad before them. on the other side the bank was steep, and \n","up it a winding path climbed from the further landing. lamps were twinkling \n","there. behind loomed up the buck hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds \n","of mist, shone many round windows, yellow and red. they were the windows \n","of \n","\n","brandy hall, the ancient home of the brandy bucks. \n","\n","long ago gorhendad oldbuck, head of the oldbuck family, one of the \n","oldest in the marish or indeed in the shire, had crossed the river, which \n","was the original boundary of the land eastwards. he built (and excavated) \n","brandy hall, changed his name to brandybuck, and settled down to become \n","master of what was virtually a small independent country. his family grew \n","and grew, and after his days continued to grow, until brandy hall occupied \n","the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, \n","and about a hundred windows. the brandybucks and their numerous \n","dependants \n","\n","then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. that was the \n","origin of buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the old \n","forest, a sort of colony from the shire. its chief village was bucklebury, \n","clustering in the banks and slopes behind brandy hall. \n","\n","the people in the marish were friendly with the bucklanders, and the \n","authority of the master of the hall (as the head of the brandybuck family \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between stock and rushey. \n","but most of the folk of the old shire regarded the bucklanders as peculiar, \n","half foreigners as it were. though, as a matter of fact, they were not very \n","different from the other hobbits of the four farthings. except in one point: \n","they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim. \n","\n","their land was originally unprotected from the east; but on that side \n","they had built a hedge: the high hay. it had been planted many generations \n","ago, and was now thick and tail, for it was constantly tended. it ran all \n","the way from brandywine bridge, in a big loop curving away from the river, \n","to haysend (where the withywindle flowed out of the forest into the \n","brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to end. but, of course, it was \n","not a complete protection. the forest drew close to the hedge in many \n","places. the bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also \n","was not usual in the shire. \n","\n","the ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. the buckland shore drew \n","nearer. sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river \n","before. he had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his \n","old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. he scratched \n","his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that mr. frodo could have gone \n","on living quietly at bag end. \n","\n","the four hobbits stepped off the ferry. merry was tying it up, and \n","pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when sam (who had been \n","looking back, as if to take farewell of the shire) said in a hoarse whisper: \n","\n","'look back, mr. frodo! do you see anything?' \n","\n","on the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a \n","figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind. but as they looked \n","it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. it \n","then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps. \n","\n","'what in the shire is that?' exclaimed merry. \n","\n","'something that is following us,' said frodo. 'but don't ask any more \n","now! let's get away at once!' they hurried up the path to the top of the \n","bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and \n","nothing could be seen. \n","\n","'thank goodness you don't keep any boats on the west -bank!' said frodo. \n","'can horses cross the river?' \n","\n","'they can go twenty miles north to brandywine bridge - or they might \n","swim,' answered merry. 'though i never heard of any horse swimming the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","brandywine. but what have horses to do with it?' i'll tell you later. let's \n","get indoors and then we can talk.' \n","\n","'all right! you and pippin know your way; so i'll just ride on and tell \n","fatty bolger that you are coming. we'll see about supper and things.' \n","\n","'we had our supper early with farmer maggot,' said frodo; 'but we could \n","do with another.' \n","\n","'you shall have it! give me that basket!' said merry, and rode ahead \n","into the darkness. \n","\n","it was some distance from the brandywine to frodo's new house at \n","crickhollow. they passed buck hill and brandy hall on their left, and on the \n","outskirts of bucklebury struck the main road of buckland that ran south from \n","the bridge. half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on \n","their right. this they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and \n","down into the country. \n","\n","at last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. nothing could be \n","seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of \n","a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer \n","hedge. frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of \n","the country, and there were no other dwellings close by. you could get in \n","and out without being noticed. it had been built a long while before by the \n","brandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to \n","escape from the crowded life of brandy hall for a time. it was an \n","old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it \n","was long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round \n","windows, and a large round door. \n","\n","as they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible; \n","the windows were dark and shuttered. frodo knocked on the door, and fatty \n","bolger opened it. a friendly light streamed out. they slipped in quickly and \n","shut themselves and the light inside. they were in a wide hall with doors on \n","either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the \n","house. \n","\n","'well, what do you think of it?' asked merry coming up the passage. 'we \n","have done our best in a short time to make it look like home. after all \n","fatty and i only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.' \n","\n","frodo looked round. it did look like home. many of his own favourite \n","things - or bilbo's things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new \n","selling) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","it was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself \n","wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement. \n","\n","it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he \n","wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave \n","them so soon, indeed at once. yet that would have to be done that very \n","night, before they all went to bed. \n","\n","'it's delightful!' he said with an effort. 'i hardly feel that i have \n","moved at all.' \n","\n","the travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the \n","floor. merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end. \n","firelight came out, and a puff of steam. \n","\n","'a bath!' cried pippin. 'o blessed meriadoc!' \n","\n","'which order shall we go in?' said frodo. 'eldest first, or quickest \n","first? you'll be last either way, master peregrin.' \n","\n","'trust me to arrange things better than that!' said merry. 'we can't \n","begin life at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. in that room there are \n","three tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. there are also towels, mats \n","and soap. get inside, and be quick!' \n","\n","merry and fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, \n","and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper. \n","snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound \n","of \n","\n","splashing and wallowing. the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above \n","the others in one of bilbo's favourite bath-songs. \n","\n","sing hey! for the bath at close of day \n","that washes the weary mud away! \n","\n","a loon is he that will not sing: \n","\n","o! water hot is a noble thing! \n","\n","o! sweet is the sound of falling rain, \n","and the brook that leaps from hill to plain; \n","but better than rain or rippling streams \n","is water hot that smokes and steams. \n","\n","o! water cold we may pour at need \n","down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed; \n","but better is beer, if drink we lack, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and water hot poured down the back. \n","\n","\n","\n","o! water is fair that leaps on high \n","\n","in a fountain white beneath the sky; \n","\n","but never did fountain sound so sweet \n","\n","as splashing hot water with my feet! \n","\n","there was a terrific splash, and a shout of whoa! from frodo. it \n","appeared that a lot of pippin's bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on \n","high. \n","\n","merry went to the door: 'what about supper and beer in the throat?' he \n","called. frodo came out drying his hair. \n","\n","'there's so much water in the air that i'm coming into the kitchen to \n","finish,' he said. \n","\n","'lawks!' said merry, looking in. the stone floor was swimming. 'you \n","ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. peregrin,' he said. \n","'hurry up, or we shan't wait for you.' \n","\n","they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. 'i suppose you \n","three won't want mushrooms again?' said fredegar without much hope. \n","\n","'yes we shall!' cried pippin. \n","\n","'they're mine!' said frodo. 'given to me by mrs. maggot, a queen among \n","farmers' wives. take your greedy hands away, and i'll serve them.' \n","\n","hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest \n","likings of big people. a fact which partly explains young frodo's long \n","expeditions to the renowned fields of the marish, and the wrath of the \n","injured maggot. on this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to \n","hobbit standards. there were also many other things to follow, and when they \n","had finished even fatty bolger heaved a sigh of content. they pushed back \n","the table, and drew chairs round the fire. \n","\n","'we'll clear up later,' said merry. 'now tell me all about it! i guess \n","that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. i \n","want a full account; and most of all i want to know what was the matter with \n","old maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. he sounded almost as if he was \n","scared, if that is possible.' \n","\n","'we have all been scared,' said pippin after a pause, in which frodo \n","stared at the fire and did not speak. 'you would have been, too, if you had \n","been chased for two days by black riders.' \n","\n","'and what are they?' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'black figures riding on black horses,' answered pippin. 'if frodo \n","won't talk, i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' he then gave \n","a full account of their journey from the time when they left hobbiton. sam \n","gave various supporting nods and exclamations. frodo remained silent. \n","\n","'i should think you were making it all up,' said merry, 'if i had not \n","seen that black shape on the landing-stage - and heard the queer sound in \n","maggot's voice. what do you make of it all, frodo?' \n","\n","'cousin frodo has been very close,' said pippin. 'but the time has come \n","for him to open out. so far we have been given nothing more to go on than \n","farmer maggot's guess that it has something to do with old bilbo's \n","treasure.' \n","\n","'that was only a guess,' said frodo hastily. 'maggot does not know \n","anything.' \n","\n","'old maggot is a shrewd fellow,' said merry. 'a lot goes on behind his \n","round face that does not come out in his talk. i've heard that he used to go \n","into the old forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good \n","many strange things. but you can at least tell us, frodo, whether you think \n","his guess good or bad.' \n","\n","'i think, ' answered frodo slowly, 'that it was a good guess, as far as \n","it goes. there is a connexion with bilbo's old adventures, and the riders \n","are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or for me. i \n","also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that i am not \n","safe here or anywhere else.' he looked round at the windows and walls, as if \n","he was afraid they would suddenly give way. the others looked at him in \n","silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves. \n","\n","'it's coming out in a minute,' whispered pippin to merry. merry nodded. \n","\n","'well!' said frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as \n","if he had made a decision. 'i can't keep it dark any longer. i have got \n","something to tell you all. but i don't know quite how to begin.' \n","\n","'i think i could help you,' said merry quietly, 'by telling you some of \n","it myself.' \n","\n","'what do you mean?' said frodo, looking at him anxiously. 'just this, \n","my dear old frodo: you are miserable, because you don't know how to say \n","good-bye. you meant to leave the shire, of course. but danger has come on \n","you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at \n","once. and you don't want to. we are very sorry for you.' \n","\n","frodo opened his mouth and shut it again. his look of surprise was so \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","comical that they laughed. 'dear old frodo!' said pippin. 'did you really \n","think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? you have not been nearly careful \n","or clever enough for that! you have obviously been planning to go and saying \n","farewell to all your haunts all this year since april. we have constantly \n","heard you muttering: \"shall i ever look down into that valley again, i \n","wonder\", and things like that. and pretending that you had come to the end \n","of your money, and actually selling your beloved bag end to those \n","sackville-bagginses! and all those close talks with gandalf.' \n","\n","'good heavens!' said frodo. 'i thought i had been both careful and \n","clever. i don't know what gandalf would say. is all the shire discussing my \n","departure then?' \n","\n","'oh no!' said merry. 'don't worry about that! the secret won't keep for \n","long, of course; but at present it is, i think, only known to us \n","conspirators. after all, you must remember that we know you well, and are \n","often with you. we can usually guess what you are thinking. i knew bilbo, \n","too. to tell you the truth, i had been watching you rather closely ever \n","since he left. i thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed i \n","expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious. we have \n","been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on \n","your own like he did. ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and \n","done a good deal of planning on our own account. you are not going to escape \n","so easily!' \n","\n","'but i must go,' said frodo. 'it cannot be helped, dear friends. it is \n","wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. since you have \n","guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!' \n","\n","'you do not understand!' said pippin. 'you must go - and therefore we \n","must, too. merry and i are coming with you. sam is an excellent fellow, and \n","would jump down a dragon's throat to save you, if he did not trip over his \n","own feet; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous \n","adventure.' \n","\n","'my dear and most beloved hobbits!' said frodo deeply moved. 'but i \n","could not allow it. i decided that long ago, too. you speak of danger, but \n","you do not understand. this is no treasure-hunt, no there-and -back journey. \n","\n","i am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.' \n","\n","'of course we understand,' said merry firmly. 'that is why we have \n","decided to come. we know the ring is no laughing -matter; but we are going to \n","do our best to help you against the enemy.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the ring!' said frodo, now completely amazed. \n","\n","'yes, the ring,' said merry. 'my dear old hobbit, you don't allow for \n","the inquisitiveness of friends. i have known about the existence of the ring \n","for years - before bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded \n","it as secret, i kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our \n","conspiracy. i did not know bilbo, of course, as well as i know you; i was \n","too young, and he was also more careful - but he was not careful enough. if \n","you want to know how i first found out, i will tell you.' \n","\n","'go on!' said frodo faintly. \n","\n","'it was the sackville-bagginses that were his downfall, as you might \n","expect. one day, a year before the party, i happened to be walking along the \n","road, when i saw bilbo ahead. suddenly in the distance the s.-b.s appeared, \n","coming towards us. bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he vanished. i \n","was so startled that i hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary \n","fashion; but i got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. i \n","was peeping through into the road, after the s.-b.s had passed, and was \n","looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. i caught a glint of \n","gold as he put something back in his trouser -pocket. \n","\n","'after that i kept my eyes open. in fact, i confess that i spied. but \n","you must admit that it was very intriguing, and i was only in my teens. i \n","must be the only one in the shire, besides you frodo, that has ever seen the \n","old fellow's secret book.' \n","\n","'you have read his book!' cried frodo. 'good heavens above! is nothing \n","safe?' \n","\n","'not too safe, i should say,' said merry. 'but i have only had one \n","rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. he never left the book about. i \n","wonder what became of it. i should like another look. have you got it, \n","frodo?' \n","\n","'no. it was not at bag end. he must have taken it away.' \n","\n","'well, as i was saying,' merry proceeded, 'i kept my knowledge to \n","myself, till this spring when things got serious. then we formed our \n","conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not \n","been too scrupulous. you are not a very easy nut to crack, and gandalf is \n","worse. but if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, i can \n","produce him.' \n","\n","'where is he?' said frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked \n","and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'step forward, sam!' said merry; and sam stood up with a face scarlet \n","up to the ears. 'here's our collector of information ! and he collected a \n","lot, i can tell you, before he was finally caught. after which, i may say, \n","he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.' \n","\n","'sam!' cried frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and \n","quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely \n","foolish. \n","\n","'yes, sir!' said sam. 'begging your pardon, sir! but i meant no wrong \n","to you, mr. frodo, nor to mr. gandalf for that matter. he has some sense, \n","mind you; and when you said go alone, he said no! lake someone as you can \n","trust. ' \n","\n","'but it does not seem that i can trust anyone,' said frodo. sam looked \n","at him unhappily. 'it all depends on what you want,' put in merry. 'you can \n","trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. and you \n","can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself. \n","\n","but you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a \n","word. we are your friends, frodo. anyway: there it is. we know most of what \n","gandalf has told you. we know a good deal about the ring. we are horribly \n","afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.' \n","\n","'and after all, sir,' added sam, 'you did ought to take the elves' \n","advice. gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can't deny \n","it.' \n","\n","'i don't deny it,' said frodo, looking at sam, who was now grinning. 'i \n","don't deny it, but i'll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you \n","snore or not. i shall kick you hard to make sure. \n","\n","'you are a set of deceitful scoundrels!' he said, turning to the \n","others. 'but bless you!' he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, 'i give \n","in. i will take gildor's advice. if the danger were not so dark, i should \n","dance for joy. even so, i cannot help feeling happy; happier than i have \n","felt for a long time. i had dreaded this evening.' \n","\n","'good! that's settled. three cheers for captain frodo and company!' \n","they shouted; and they danced round him. merry and pippin began a song, \n","which they had apparently got ready for the occasion. \n","\n","it was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started bilbo on his \n","adventure long ago, and went to the same tune: \n","\n","farewell we call to hearth and hall! \n","\n","though wind may blow and rain may fall, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","we must away ere break of day \n","far over wood and mountain tall. \n","\n","\n","\n","to rivendell, where elves yet dwell \n","in glades beneath the misty fell, \n","\n","through moor and waste we ride in haste, \n","\n","and whither then we cannot tell. \n","\n","with foes ahead, behind us dread, \n","\n","beneath the sky shall be our bed, \n","\n","until at last our toil be passed, \n","\n","our journey done, our errand sped. \n","\n","we must away! we must away! \n","\n","we ride before the break of day! \n","\n","'very good!' said frodo. 'but in that case there are a lot of things to \n","do before we go to bed - under a roof, for tonight at any rate.' \n","\n","'oh! that was poetry!' said pippin. 'do you really mean to start before \n","the break of day?' \n","\n","'i don't know,' answered frodo. 'i fear those black riders, and i am \n","sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place to which \n","it is known i was going. also gildor advised me not to wait. but i should \n","very much like to see gandalf. i could see that even gildor was disturbed \n","when he heard that gandalf had never appeared. it really depends on two \n","things. flow soon could the riders get to bucklebury? and how soon could \n","we \n","\n","get off? it will take a good deal of preparation.' \n","\n","'the answer to the second question,' said merry, 'is that we could get \n","off in an hour. i have prepared practically everything. there are six ponies \n","in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for \n","a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.' \n","\n","'it seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,' said frodo. 'but \n","what about the black riders? would it be safe to wait one day for gandalf?' \n","\n","'that all depends on what you think the riders would do, if they found \n","you here,' answered merry. 'they could have reached here by now, of course, \n","if they were not stopped at the north-gate, where the hedge runs down to the \n","river -bank, just this side of the bridge. the gate-guards would not let them \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","through by night, though they might break through. even in the daylight they \n","would try to keep them out, i think, at any rate until they got a message \n","through to the master of the hall - for they would not like the look of the \n","riders, and would certainly be frightened by them. but, of course, buckland \n","cannot resist a determined attack for long. and it is possible that in the \n","morning even a black rider that rode up and asked for mr. baggins would be \n","let through. it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live \n","at crickhollow.' \n","\n","frodo sat for a while in thought. 'i have made up my mind,' he said \n","finally. 'i am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. but i am not going \n","by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. if i go through the \n","north-gate my departure from buckland will be known at once, instead of \n","being secret for several days at least, as it might be. and what is more, \n","the bridge and the east road near the borders will certainly be watched, \n","whether any rider gets into buckland or not. we don't know how many there \n","are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. the only thing to do is \n","to go off in a quite unexpected direction.' \n","\n","'but that can only mean going into the old forest!' said fredegar \n","horrified. 'you can't be thinking of doing that. it is quite as dangerous as \n","black riders.' \n","\n","'not quite,' said merry. it sounds very desperate, but i believe frodo \n","is right. it is the only way of getting off without being followed at once. \n","\n","with luck we might gel a considerable start.' \n","\n","'but you won't have any luck in the old forest,' objected fredegar. 'no \n","one ever has luck in there. you'll gel lost. people don't go in there.' \n","\n","'oh yes they do!' said merry. 'the brandybucks go in - occasionally \n","when the fit takes them. we have a private entrance. frodo went in once, \n","long ago. i have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when \n","the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.' \n","\n","'well, do as you think best!' said fredegar. 'i am more afraid of the \n","old forest than of anything i know about: the stories about it are a \n","nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as i am not going on the journey. \n","\n","still, i am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell gandalf what \n","you have done, when he turns up, as i am sure he will before long.' \n","\n","fond as he was of frodo, fatty bolger had no desire to leave the shire, \n","nor to see what lay outside it. his family came from the eastfarthing, from \n","budgeford in bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the brandywine \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","bridge. his task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was \n","to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as \n","possible the pretence that mr. baggins was still living at crickhollow. he \n","had even brought along some old clothes of frodo's to help him in playing \n","the part. they little thought how dangerous that part might prove. \n","\n","'excellent!' said frodo, when he understood the plan. 'we could not \n","have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise. i don't know whether \n","these riders can read or not, of course, but i should not have dared to risk \n","a written message, in case they got in and searched the house. but if fatty \n","is willing to hold the fort, and i can be sure of gandalf knowing the way we \n","have gone, that decides me. i am going into the old forest first thing \n","tomorrow.' \n","\n","'well, that's that,' said pippin. 'on the whole i would rather have our \n","job than fatty's - waiting here till black riders come.' \n","\n","'you wait till you are well inside the forest,' said fredegar. 'you'll \n","wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.' \n","\n","'it's no good arguing about it any more,' said merry. 'we have still \n","got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before we get \n","to bed. i shall call you all before the break of day.' \n","\n","when at last he had got to bed, frodo could not sleep for some time. \n","\n","his legs ached. he. was glad that he was riding in the morning. eventually \n","he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high \n","window over a dark sea of tangled trees. down below among the roots there \n","was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. he felt sure they would \n","smell him out sooner or later. \n","\n","then he heard a noise in the distance. at first he thought it was a \n","great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. then he knew that it was \n","not leaves, but the sound of the sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in \n","waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. suddenly he found he \n","was out in the open. there were no trees after all. he was on a dark heath, \n","and there was a strange salt smell in the air. looking up he saw before him \n","a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. a great desire came over \n","him to climb the tower and see the sea. he started to struggle up the ridge \n","towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a \n","noise of thunder. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 6. the old forest \n","\n","\n","\n","frodo woke suddenly. it was still dark in the room. merry was standing \n","there with a candle in one hand, and banging on the door with the other. \n","\n","'all right! what is it?' said frodo, still shaken and bewildered. \n","\n","'what is it!' cried merry. 'it is time to get up. it is half past four \n","and very foggy. come on! sam is already getting breakfast ready. even pippin \n","is up. i am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be \n","the baggage-carrier. wake that sluggard fatty! at least he must get up and \n","see us off.' \n","\n","soon after six o'clock the five hobbits were ready to start. fatty \n","bolger was still yawning. they stole quietly out of the house. merry went in \n","front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that went through \n","a spinney behind the house, and then cut across several fields. the leaves \n","of trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey \n","with cold dew. everything was still, and far-away noises seemed near and \n","clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door of a distant \n","house. \n","\n","in their shed they found the ponies; sturdy little beasts of the kind \n","loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day's work. they mounted, \n","and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed to open \n","reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. after riding for \n","about an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the fledge looming \n","suddenly ahead. it was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs. 'how are \n","you going to get through this?' asked fredegar. 'follow me!' said merry, \n","\n","'and you will see.' he turned to the left along the hedge, and soon they \n","came to a point where it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. a \n","cutting had been made, at some distance from the hedge, and went sloping \n","gently down into the ground. it had walls of brick at the sides, which rose \n","steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived \n","deep under the hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side. \n","\n","here fatty bolger halted. 'good-bye, frodo!' he said. 'i wish you were \n","not going into the forest. i only hope you will not need rescuing before the \n","day is out. but good luck to you - today and every day!' \n","\n","'if there are no worse things ahead than the old forest, i shall be \n","lucky,' said frodo. 'tell gandalf to hurry along the east road: we shall \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.' 'good-bye!' they cried, and \n","rode down the slope and disappeared from fredegar's sight into the tunnel. \n","\n","it was dark and damp. at the far end it was closed by a gate of \n","thick-set iron bars. merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had \n","all passed through he pushed it to again. it shut with a clang, and the lock \n","clicked. the sound was ominous. \n","\n","'there!' said merry. 'you have left the shire, and are now outside, and \n","on the edge of the old forest.' \n","\n","'are the stories about it true?' asked pippin. \n","\n","'i don't know what stories you mean,' merry answered. 'if you mean the \n","old bogey-stories fatty's nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves \n","and things of that sort, i should say no. at any rate i don't believe them. \n","\n","but the forest is queer. everything in it is very much more alive, more \n","aware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the shire. and \n","the trees do not like strangers. they watch you. they are usually content \n","merely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts, and don't do much. \n","occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root \n","out, or grasp at you with a long trailer. but at night things can be most \n","alarming, or so i am told. i have only once or twice been in here after \n","dark, and then only near the hedge. i thought all the trees were whispering \n","to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; \n","and the branches swayed and groped without any wind. they do say the trees \n","do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. in fact long \n","ago they attacked the hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it, \n","and leaned over it. but the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and \n","made a great bonfire in the forest, and burned all the ground in a long \n","strip east of the hedge. after that the trees gave up the attack, but they \n","became very unfriendly. there is still a wide bare space not far inside \n","where the bonfire was made.' \n","\n","'is it only the trees that are dangerous?' asked pippin. \n","\n","'there are various queer things living deep in the forest, and on the \n","far side,' said merry, 'or at least i have heard so; but i have never seen \n","any of them. but something makes paths. whenever one comes inside one \n","finds \n","\n","open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer \n","fashion. not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the \n","beginning of quite a broad path leading to the bonfire glade, and then on \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","more or less in our direction, east and a little north. that is the path i \n","am going to try and find.' \n","\n","the hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. \n","\n","on the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the forest, a \n","hundred yards and more beyond the hedge; but it vanished as soon as it \n","brought them under the trees. looking back they could see the dark line of \n","the hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them. \n","looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and \n","shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or \n","gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and \n","slimy, shaggy growths. \n","\n","merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. 'you had better lead on and find \n","that path,' frodo said to him. 'don't let us lose one another, or forget \n","which way the hedge lies!' \n","\n","they picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, \n","carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots. there was no \n","undergrowth. the ground was rising steadily, and as they went forward it \n","seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. there was no \n","sound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still \n","leaves. for the moment there was no whispering or movement among the \n","branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being \n","watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. the feeling \n","steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing \n","back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow. \n","\n","there was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed \n","constantly to bar their way. pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it \n","any longer, and without warning let out a shout. 'oi! oi !' he cried. 'i am \n","not going to do anything. just let me pass through, will you!' \n","\n","the others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy \n","curtain. there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become \n","more \n","\n","crowded and more watchful than before. \n","\n","'i should not shout, if i were you,' said merry. it does more harm than \n","good.' \n","\n","frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if \n","he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood. merry \n","was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","pippin noticed it. 'it has not taken you long to lose us,' he said. but at \n","that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead. \n","\n","'well, well!' he said. 'these trees do shift. there is the bonfire \n","glade in front of us (or i hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved \n","away!' \n","\n","the light grew clearer as they went forward. suddenly they came out of \n","the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. there was sky above \n","them, blue and clear to their surprise, for down under the forest -roof they \n","had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist. the \n","sun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into the clearing, \n","though its light was on the tree-tops. the leaves were all thicker and \n","greener about the edges of the glade, enclosing it with an almost solid \n","wall. no tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky and \n","faded hemlocks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and \n","rampant nettles and thistles. a dreary place: but it seemed a charming and \n","cheerful garden after the close forest. \n","\n","the hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening \n","daylight in the sky. at the far side of the glade there was a break in the \n","wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. they could see it running on into \n","the wood, wide in places and open above, though every now and again the \n","trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. up this path they \n","rode. they were still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and \n","with better heart; for it seemed to them that the forest had relented, and \n","was going to let them pass unhindered after all. \n","\n","but after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. the trees drew \n","close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. now \n","stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on \n","them. so silent was it that the fall of their ponies' hoofs, rustling on \n","dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in \n","their ears. frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank \n","to a murmur. \n","\n","o! wanderers in the shadowed land \n","despair not! for though dark they stand, \n","all woods there be must end at last, \n","and see the open sun go past: \n","the setting sun, the rising sun, \n","the day's end, or the day begun. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","for east or west all woods must fail... \n","\n","fail - even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. the air \n","seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome. just behind them a large \n","branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path. the \n","trees seemed to close in before them. \n","\n","they do not like all that about ending and failing,' said merry. 'i \n","should not sing any more at present. wait till we do get to the edge, and \n","then we'll turn and give them a rousing chorus!' \n","\n","he spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show \n","it. the others did not answer. they were depressed. a heavy weight was \n","settling steadily on frodo's heart, and he regretted now with every step \n","forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees. he \n","was, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still \n","possible), when things took a new turn. the path stopped climbing, and \n","became for a while nearly level. the dark trees drew aside, and ahead they \n","could see the path going almost straight forward. before them, but some \n","distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald \n","head out of the encircling wood. the path seemed to be making directly for \n","it. \n","\n","they now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing \n","out for a while above the roof of the forest. the path dipped, and then \n","again began to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep \n","hillside. there it left the trees and faded into the turf. the wood stood \n","all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a \n","shaven crown. \n","\n","the hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they \n","reached the top. there they stood and gazed about them. the air was gleaming \n","and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. near at \n","hand the mist was now almost gone; though here and there it lay in hollows \n","of the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right \n","across the forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke. \n","\n","'that,' said merry, pointing with his hand, 'that is the line of the \n","withywindle. it comes down out of the downs and flows south-west through \n","the \n","\n","midst of the forest to join the brandywine below haysend. we don't want to \n","go that way! the withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the \n","whole wood - the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the others looked in the direction that merry pointed out, but they \n","could see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley; and beyond it \n","the southern half of the forest faded from view. \n","\n","the sun on the hill-lop was now getting hot. it must have been about \n","eleven o'clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in \n","other directions. in the west they could not make out either the line of the \n","hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it. northward, where they \n","looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the \n","great east road, for which they were making. they were on an island in a sea \n","of trees, and the horizon was veiled. \n","\n","on the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the \n","slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like \n","island-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep \n","waters. they sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, \n","while they ate their mid-day meal. as the sun rose and passed noon they \n","glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of the downs that lay \n","beyond the old forest on that side. that cheered them greatly; for it was \n","good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood's borders, though they did \n","not mean to go that way, if they could help it: the barrow-downs had as \n","sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the forest itself. \n","\n","at length they made up their minds to go on again. the path that had \n","brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; but they had not \n","followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the \n","right. soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must \n","actually be heading towards the withy windle valley: not at all the direction \n","they wished lo take. after some discussion they decided to leave this \n","misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to \n","see it from the hill-top, the road must lie that way, and it could not be \n","many miles off. also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed \n","lo be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were \n","thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange \n","and nameless trees of the denser wood. \n","\n","at first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair \n","speed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they \n","seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. but after a time the trees \n","began to close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance to be \n","thinner and less tangled. then deep folds in the ground were discovered \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","unexpectedly, like the ruts of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken \n","roads long disused and choked with brambles. these lay usually right across \n","their line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out \n","again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. each time they \n","climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted \n","undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way \n","when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along the \n","bottom before they could find a way up the further bank. each time they \n","clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left \n","and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the \n","right and downwards. \n","\n","after an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though \n","they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. they \n","were being headed off, and were simply following a course chosen for them - \n","eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the forest and not out of it. \n","\n","the afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a \n","fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met. it was so sleep \n","and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again, either \n","forwards or backwards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage \n","behind. all they could do was to follow the fold - downwards. the ground \n","grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they \n","found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy \n","bed. then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and \n","noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. they were in a deep dim-lit gully \n","over-arched by trees high above them. \n","\n","after stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite \n","suddenly out of the gloom. as if through a gate they saw the sunlight before \n","them. coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down \n","through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. at its feet was a wide \n","space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank \n","almost as steep. a golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy \n","upon the hidden land between. in the midst of it there wound lazily a dark \n","river of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with \n","willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded \n","willow-leaves. the air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the \n","branches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the \n","valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'well, now i have at least some notion of where we are!' said merry. \n","\n","'we have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended. this is \n","the river withy windle! i will go on and explore.' \n","\n","he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses. \n","after a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground \n","between the cliff-foot and the river; in some places firm turf went down to \n","the water's edge. 'what's more,' he said, 'there seems to be something like \n","a footpath winding along on this side of the river. if we turn left and \n","follow it, we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the forest \n","eventually.' \n","\n","'i dare say!' said pippin. 'that is, if the track goes on so far, and \n","does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. who made the track, \n","do you suppose, and why? i am sure it was not for our benefit. i am getting \n","very suspicious of this forest and everything in it, and i begin to believe \n","all the stories about it. and have you any idea how far eastward we should \n","have to go?' \n","\n","'no,' said merry, 'i haven't. i don't know in the least how far down \n","the withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to \n","make \n","\n","a path along it. but there is no other way out that i can see or think of.' \n","\n","there being nothing else for it, they filed out, and merry led them to \n","the path that he had discovered. everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush \n","and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy \n","to follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among \n","the bogs and pools. here and there it passed over other rills, running down \n","gullies into the withywindle out of the higher forest-lands, and at these \n","points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across. \n","\n","the hobbits began to feel very hot. there were armies of flies of all \n","kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun was burning on their \n","backs. at last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branches \n","reached across the path. each step forward became more reluctant than the \n","last. sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs, \n","and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes. \n","\n","frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. just in front of him \n","pippin fell forward on to his knees. frodo halted. 'it's no good,' he heard \n","merry saying. 'can't go another step without rest. must have nap. it's cool \n","under the willows. less flies!' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","frodo did not like the sound of this. 'come on!' he cried. 'we can't \n","have a nap yet. we must get clear of the forest first.' but the others were \n","too far gone to care. beside them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly. \n","\n","suddenly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. his head swam. \n","there now seemed hardly a sound in the air. the flies had stopped buzzing. \n","only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing, a soft fluttering as of a song \n","half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. he lifted his heavy eyes \n","and saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old and hoary. enormous it \n","looked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many \n","long-fingered hands, its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures \n","that creaked faintly as the boughs moved. the leaves fluttering against the \n","bright sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the \n","grass. \n","\n","merry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their \n","backs to the willow-trunk. behind them the great cracks gaped wide to \n","receive them as the tree swayed and creaked. they looked up at the grey and \n","yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. they shut their \n","eyes, and then it seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, \n","saying something about water and sleep. they gave themselves up to the spell \n","and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow. \n","\n","frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering \n","him; then with an effort he struggled to his feel again. he felt a \n","compelling desire for cool water. 'wait for me, sam,' he stammered. 'must \n","bathe feet a minute.' \n","\n","half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree, \n","where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled dragonets \n","straining down to drink. he straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel \n","in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back \n","against the tree. \n","\n","sam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern. he was \n","worried. the afternoon was getting late, and he thought this sudden \n","sleepiness uncanny. 'there's more behind this than sun and warm air,' he \n","muttered to himself. 'i don't like this great big tree. i don't trust it. \n","\n","hark at it singing about sleep now! this won't do at all!' \n","\n","he pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become \n","of the ponies. he found that two had wandered on a good way along the path; \n","and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others, when \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","he heard two noises; one loud, and the other soft but very clear. one was \n","the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise \n","like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast. \n","\n","he rushed back to the bank. frodo was in the water close to the edge, \n","and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was \n","not struggling. sam gripped him by the jacket, and dragged him from under \n","the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank. almost at once \n","he woke, and coughed and spluttered. \n","\n","'do you know, sam,' he said at length, 'the beastly tree threw me in! i \n","felt it. the big root just twisted round and tipped me in!' \n","\n","'you were dreaming i expect, mr. frodo,' said sam. 'you shouldn't sit \n","in such a place, if you feel sleepy.' \n","\n","'what about the others?' frodo asked. 'i wonder what sort of dreams \n","they are having.' \n","\n","they went round to the other side of the tree, and then sam understood \n","the click that he had heard. pippin had vanished. the crack by which he had \n","laid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. merry \n","was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, \n","but the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped \n","like a pair of pincers. \n","\n","frodo and sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where pippin had lain. \n","\n","they then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held \n","poor merry. it was quite useless. \n","\n","'what a foul thing to happen!' cried frodo wildly. 'why did we ever \n","come into this dreadful forest? i wish we were all back at crickhollow!' he \n","kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his own feet. a hardly \n","perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves \n","rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter. \n","\n","'i suppose we haven't got an axe among our luggage, mr. frodo?' asked \n","sam. \n","\n","'i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,' said frodo. 'that \n","wouldn't be much use.' \n","\n","'wait a minute!' cried sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. \n","\n","'we might do something with fire!' \n","\n","'we might,' said frodo doubtfully. 'we might succeed in roasting pippin \n","alive inside.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'we might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,' said sam \n","fiercely. 'if it don't let them go, i'll have it down, if i have to gnaw \n","it.' he ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-boxes \n","and a hatchet. \n","\n","quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made \n","a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks. these they heaped against the \n","trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners. as soon as sam had \n","struck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of \n","flame and smoke went up. the twigs crackled. little fingers of fire licked \n","against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it. a tremor \n","ran through the whole willow. the leaves seemed to hiss above their heads \n","with a sound of pain and anger. a loud scream came from merry, and from far \n","inside the tree they heard pippin give a muffled yell. \n","\n","'put it out! put it out!' cried merry. 'he'll squeeze me in two, if you \n","don't. he says so!' \n","\n","'who? what?' shouted frodo, rushing round to the other side of the \n","tree. \n","\n","'put it out! put it out!' begged merry. the branches of the willow \n","began to sway violently. there was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading \n","outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they \n","had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river -valley and set up \n","ripples of anger that ran out over the whole forest. sam kicked at the \n","little fire and stamped out the sparks. but frodo, without any clear idea of \n","why he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the path crying help! help! \n","help! it seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill \n","voice: it was blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a \n","clamour of leaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. he felt desperate: \n","lost and witless. \n","\n","suddenly he slopped. there was an answer, or so he thought; but it \n","seemed to come from behind him, away down the path further back in the \n","forest. he turned round and listened, and soon there could be no doubt: \n","someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and \n","happily, but it was singing nonsense: \n","\n","hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! \n","\n","ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! \n","\n","tom bom, jolly tom, tom bombadillo! \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, frodo and sam now both \n","stood still. suddenly out of a long string of nonsense-words (or so they \n","seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song: \n","\n","hey! come merry dot ! derry dol! my darling! \n","\n","light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling. \n","\n","down along under hill, shining in the sunlight, \n","\n","waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight, \n","\n","there my pretty lady is. river-woman's daughter, \n","\n","slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water. \n","\n","old tom bombadil water-lilies bringing \n","\n","comes hopping home again. can you hear him singing? \n","\n","hey! come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o, \n","\n","goldberry, goldberry, merry yellow berry-o! \n","\n","poor old willow-man, you tuck your roots away! \n","\n","tom's in a hurry now. evening will follow day. \n","\n","tom's going home again water-lilies bringing. \n","\n","hey! come derry dol! can you hear me singing? \n","\n","frodo and sam stood as if enchanted. the wind puffed out. the leaves \n","hung silently again on stiff branches. there was another burst of song, and \n","then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there appeared above the \n","reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in \n","the band. with another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it \n","seemed. at any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite \n","tall enough for one of the big people, though he made noise enough for one, \n","slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging \n","through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. he had a blue coat \n","and a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red \n","as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter. in his \n","hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white \n","water-lilies. \n","\n","'help!' cried frodo and sam running towards him with their hands \n","stretched out. \n","\n","'whoa! whoa! steady there!' cried the old man, holding up one hand, and \n","they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. 'now, my little \n","fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows? what's the matter \n","here then? do you know who i am? i'm tom bombadil. tell me what's \n","your \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","trouble! tom's in a hurry now. don't you crush my lilies!' \n","\n","'my friends are caught in the willow-tree,' cried frodo breathlessly. \n","\n","'master merry's being squeezed in a crack!' cried sam. \n","\n","'what?' shouted tom bombadil, leaping up in the air. 'old man willow? \n","naught worse than that, eh? that can soon be mended. i know the tune for \n","him. old grey willow-man! i'll freeze his marrow cold, if he don't behave \n","himself. i'll sing his roots off. i'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and \n","branch away. old man willow!' setting down his lilies carefully on the \n","grass, he ran to the tree. there he saw merry's feet still sticking out - \n","the rest had already been drawn further inside. tom put his mouth to the \n","crack and began singing into it in a low voice. they could not catch the \n","words, but evidently merry was aroused. his legs began to kick. tom sprang \n","away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with \n","it. 'you let them out again, old man willow!' he said. 'what be you \n","a-thinking of? you should not be waking. eat earth! dig deep! drink water! \n","go to sleep! bombadil is talking!' he then seized merry's feet and drew him \n","out of the suddenly widening crack. \n","\n","there was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it \n","pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. then with a loud snap both cracks \n","closed fast again. a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip, and \n","complete silence fell. \n","\n","'thank you!' said the hobbits, one after the other. \n","\n","tom bombadil burst out laughing. 'well, my little fellows!' said he, \n","stooping so that he peered into their faces. 'you shall come home with me! \n","the table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and \n","butter. goldberry is waiting. time enough for questions around the supper \n","table. you follow after me as quick as you are able!' with that he picked up \n","his lilies, and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and \n","dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and nonsensically. \n","\n","too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him \n","as fast as they could. but that was not fast enough. tom soon disappeared in \n","front of them, and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away. \n","suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo! \n","\n","hop along, my little friends, up the withywindle! \n","\n","tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle. \n","\n","down west sinks the sun: soon you will be groping. \n","\n","when the night-shadows fall, then the door will open, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow. \n","\n","fear no alder black! heed no hoary willow! \n","\n","fear neither root nor bough! tom goes on before you. \n","\n","hey now! merry dot! we'll be waiting for you! \n","\n","after that the hobbits heard no more. almost at once the sun seemed to \n","sink into the trees behind them. they thought of the slanting light of \n","evening glittering on the brandywine river, and the windows of bucklebury \n","beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights. great shadows fell across them; \n","trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path. white \n","mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the \n","roots of the trees upon its borders. out of the very ground at their feet a \n","shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk. \n","\n","it became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. their \n","legs seemed leaden. strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on \n","either side of them; and if they looked up to the pale sky, they caught \n","sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the \n","twilight, and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the \n","wood. they began to feel that all this country was unreal, and that they \n","were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening. \n","\n","just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed \n","that the ground was gently rising. the water began to murmur. in the \n","darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the river flowed over \n","a short fall. then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left \n","behind. they stepped out from the forest, and found a wide sweep of grass \n","welling up before them. the river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily \n","down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars, which \n","were already shining in the sky. \n","\n","the grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown \n","or shaven. the eaves of the forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge. \n","the path was now plain before them, well -tended and bordered with stone. it \n","wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry \n","night; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the \n","twinkling lights of a house. down again the path went, and then up again, up \n","a long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light. suddenly a wide yellow \n","beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. there was tom \n","bombadil's house before them, up, down, under hill. behind it a steep \n","shoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night. \n","\n","they all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. already half their \n","weariness and all their fears had fallen from them. hey! come merry dol! \n","rolled out the song to greet them. \n","\n","hey! come derry dol! hop along, my hearties! \n","\n","hobbits! ponies all! we are fond of parties. \n","\n","now let the fun begin! let us sing together! \n","\n","then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as spring, like the \n","song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in \n","the hills, came falling like silver to meet them: \n","\n","now let the song begin! let us sing together \n","\n","of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather, \n","\n","light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather, \n","\n","wind on the open hill, bells on the heather, \n","\n","reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water: \n","\n","old tom bombadil and the river-daughter! \n","\n","and with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden \n","light was all about them. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 7 . in the house of tom bombadil \n","\n","\n","\n","the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood \n","still, blinking. they were in a long low room, filled with the light of \n","lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished \n","wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly. \n","\n","in a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a \n","woman. her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was \n","green, \n","\n","green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was \n","of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of \n","forget-me-nots. about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown \n","earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be \n","enthroned in the midst of a pool. \n","\n","'enter, good guests!' she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was \n","her clear voice they had heard singing. they came a few timid steps further \n","into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surprised and \n","awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of \n","water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers. \n","but before they could say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the \n","lily -bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled \n","softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river. \n","\n","'come dear folk!' she said, taking frodo by the hand. faugh and be \n","merry! i am goldberry, daughter of the river.' then lightly she passed them \n","and closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread \n","out across it. 'let us shut out the night!' she said. 'for you are still \n","afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. \n","fear nothing! for tonight you are under the roof of tom bombadil.' \n","\n","the hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and \n","smiled. 'fair lady goldberry!' said frodo at last, feeling his heart moved \n","with a joy that he did not understand. he stood as he had at times stood \n","enchanted by fair el ven- voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was \n","different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to \n","mortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange. 'fair lady goldberry!' he said \n","again. 'now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","me. \n","\n","o slender as a willow-wand! o clearer than clear water ! \n","\n","o reed by the living pool! fair river-daughter! \n","\n","o spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after! \n","\n","o wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!' \n","\n","suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear \n","himself saying such things. but goldberry laughed. \n","\n","'welcome!' she said. 'i had not heard that folk of the shire were so \n","sweet -tongued. but i see you are an elf-friend; the light in your eyes and \n","the ring in your voice tells it. this is a merry meeting! sit now, and wait \n","for the master of the house! he will not be long. he is tending your tired \n","beasts.' \n","\n","the hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while goldberry \n","busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender \n","grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. from somewhere behind \n","the house came the sound of singing. every now and again they caught, among \n","many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words: \n","\n","old tom bombadil is a merry fellow; \n","\n","bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow. \n","\n","'fair lady!' said frodo again after a while. 'tell me, if my asking \n","does not seem foolish, who is tom bombadil?' \n","\n","'he is,' said goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling. \n","\n","frodo looked at her questioningly. 'he is, as you have seen him,' she \n","said in answer to his look. 'he is the master of wood, water, and hill.' \n","\n","'then all this strange land belongs to him?' \n","\n","'no indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'that would indeed be a \n","burden,' she added in a low voice, as if to herself. 'the trees and the \n","grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to \n","themselves. tom bombadil is the master. no one has ever caught old tom \n","walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under \n","light and shadow. he has no fear. tom bombadil is master.' \n","\n","a door opened and in came tom bombadil. he had now no hat and his \n","thick \n","\n","brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. he laughed, and going to \n","goldberry, took her hand. \n","\n","'here's my pretty lady!' he said, bowing to the hobbits. 'here's my \n","goldberry clothed all in silver -green with flowers in her girdle! is the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","table laden? i see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter; \n","milk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. is that enough for \n","us? is the supper ready?' \n","\n","'it is,' said goldberry; 'but the guests perhaps are not?' \n","\n","tom clapped his hands and cried: 'tom, tom! your guests are tired, and \n","you had near forgotten! come now, my merry friends, and tom will refresh \n","you! you shall clean grimy hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your \n","muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!' \n","\n","he opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and \n","round a sharp turn. they came to a low room with a sloping roof (a \n","penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house). its walls \n","were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats \n","and yellow curtains. the floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green \n","rushes. there were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, \n","laid on the floor along one side. against the opposite wall was a long bench \n","laden with wide earthenware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled \n","with water, some cold, some steaming hot. there were soft green slippers set \n","ready beside each bed. \n","\n","before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the \n","table, two on each side, while at either end sat goldberry and the master. \n","\n","it was a long and merry meal. though the hobbits ate, as only famished \n","hobbits can eat, there was no lack. the drink in their drinking -bowls seemed \n","to be clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free \n","their voices. the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing \n","merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking. \n","\n","at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. the \n","guests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, each with a \n","footstool to his tired feet. there was a fire in the wide hearth before \n","them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built of \n","apple-wood. when everything was set in order, all the lights in the room \n","were put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the \n","chimney-shelf. then goldberry came and stood before them, holding a candle; \n","and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep. \n","\n","'have peace now,' she said, 'until the morning! heed no nightly noises! \n","\n","for nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the \n","wind off the hill-top. good night!' she passed out of the room with a \n","glimmer and a rustle. the sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night. \n","\n","tom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them tried to \n","muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at \n","supper. sleep gathered on their eyelids. at last frodo spoke: \n","\n","'did you hear me calling, master, or was it just chance that brought \n","you at that moment?' \n","\n","tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. 'eh, what?' said \n","he. 'did i hear you calling? nay, i did not hear: i was busy singing. just \n","chance brought me then, if chance you call it. it was no plan of mine, \n","though i was waiting for you. we heard news of you, and learned that you \n","were wandering. we guessed you'd come ere long down to the water: all paths \n","lead that way, down to withywindle. old grey willow-man, he's a mighty \n","singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes. but tom \n","had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.' tom nodded as if sleep was \n","taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice: \n","\n","i had an errand there: gathering water-lilies, \n","green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady, \n","the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter, \n","to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted. \n","\n","each year at summer's end i go to find them for her, \n","in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down withywindle; \n","there they open first in spring and there they linger latest. \n","\n","by that pool long ago i found the river-daughter, \n","fair young goldberry sitting in the rushes. \n","\n","sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating! \n","\n","he opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue: \n","\n","and that proved well for you - for now i shall no longer \n","go down deep again along the forest-water, \n","not while the year is old. nor shall i be passing \n","old man willow's house this side of spring-time, \n","not till the merry spring, when the river-daughter \n","dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water. \n","\n","he fell silent again; but frodo could not help asking one more \n","question: the one he most desired to have answered. 'tell us, master,' he \n","said, 'about the willow-man. what is he? i have never heard of him before.' \n","\n","'no, don't!' said merry and pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. \n","\n","'not now! not until the morning!' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","that is right!' said the old man. 'now is the time for resting. some \n","things are ill to hear when the world's in shadow. sleep till the \n","morning -light, rest on the pillow ! heed no nightly noise! fear no grey \n","willow!' and with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a \n","candle in either hand he led them out of the room. \n","\n","their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were \n","of white wool. they had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn \n","the light covers over them before they were asleep. \n","\n","in the dead night, frodo lay in a dream without light. then he saw the \n","young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall \n","of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. it seemed to frodo that \n","he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of \n","hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a \n","pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. on its top stood \n","the figure of a man. the moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above \n","his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. up from the \n","dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many \n","wolves. suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the \n","moon. the figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he \n","wielded. a mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. the voices wailed \n","and \n","\n","the wolves yammered. there was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it \n","was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the east. \n","'black riders!' thought frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs \n","still echoing in his mind. he wondered if he would ever again have the \n","courage to leave the safety of these stone walls. he lay motionless, still \n","listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep \n","again or wandered into some other unremembered dream. \n","\n","at his side pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his \n","dreams and he turned and groaned. suddenly he woke, or thought he had \n","waked, \n","\n","and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: \n","tip-tap, squeak : the noise was like branches fretting in the wind, \n","twig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak. he wondered if \n","there were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a \n","dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the \n","willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","again. he sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay \n","down again relieved. he seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: 'fear \n","nothing! have peace until the morning! heed no nightly noises!' then he went \n","to sleep again. \n","\n","it was the sound of water that merry heard falling into his quiet \n","sleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading \n","irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. it gurgled \n","under the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. 'i shall be drowned!' he \n","thought. it will find its way in, and then i shall drown.' he felt that he \n","was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his fool on the \n","corner of a cold hard flagstone. then he remembered where he was and lay \n","down again. he seemed to hear or remember hearing: 'nothing passes doors or \n","windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top.' a \n","little breath of sweet air moved the curtain. he breathed deep and fell \n","asleep again. \n","\n","as far as he could remember, sam slept through the night in deep \n","content, if logs are contented. \n","\n","they woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. tom was moving \n","about the room whistling like a starling. when he heard them stir he clapped \n","his hands, and cried: 'hey! come merry dol! derry dol! my hearties!' he drew \n","back the yellow curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had covered the \n","windows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking \n","west. \n","\n","they leapt up refreshed. frodo ran to the eastern window, and found \n","himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. he had half expected to \n","see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints. actually \n","his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far \n","beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. it was a \n","pale morning: in the east, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool \n","stained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of yellow. the sky spoke of \n","rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on \n","the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves. \n","\n","pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. the \n","forest was hidden under a fog. it was like looking down on to a sloping \n","cloud-roof from above. there was a fold or channel where the mist was broken \n","into many plumes and billows; the valley of the withywindle. the stream ran \n","down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. near at hand \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","was a flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver -netted, and beyond that grey \n","shaven grass pale with dew-drops. there was no willow-tree to be seen. \n","\n","'good morning, merry friends!' cried tom, opening the eastern window \n","wide. a cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. 'sun won't show her face \n","much today. i'm thinking. i have been walking wide, leaping on the hilltops, \n","since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet \n","sky above me. i wakened goldberry singing under window; but nought \n","wakes \n","\n","hobbit-folk in the early morning. in the night little folk wake up in the \n","darkness, and sleep after light has come! ring a ding dillo! wake now, my \n","merry friends! forget the nightly noises! ring a ding dillo del! derry del, \n","my hearties! if you come soon you'll find breakfast on the table. if you \n","come late you'll get grass and rain-water!' \n","\n","needless to say - not that tom's threat sounded very serious - the \n","hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo \n","look rather empty. neither tom nor goldberry were there. tom could be heard \n","about the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and \n","singing here and there outside. the room looked westward over the \n","mist-clouded valley, and the window was open. water dripped down from the \n","thatched eaves above. before they had finished breakfast the clouds had \n","joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and \n","steadily down. behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled. \n","\n","as they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was \n","flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of goldberry singing \n","up above them. they could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that \n","the song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the \n","tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the sea far below. the \n","hobbits listened with delight; and frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed \n","the kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing. the thought of \n","going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed \n","now \n","\n","that they would not go further that day. \n","\n","the upper wind settled in the west and deeper and wetter clouds rolled \n","up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the downs. nothing could \n","be seen all round the house but falling water. frodo stood near the open \n","door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","go bubbling away down into the valley. tom bombadil came trotting round \n","the \n","\n","corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain - and \n","indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his \n","boots. these he took off and put in the chimney-corner. then he sat in the \n","largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him. \n","\n","this is goldberry's washing day,' he said, 'and her autumn-cleaning. \n","\n","too wet for hobbit-folk - let them rest while they are able! it's a good day \n","for long tales, for questions and for answers, so tom will start the \n","talking.' \n","\n","he then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if \n","speaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue \n","eye under his deep brows. often his voice would turn to song, and he would \n","get out of his chair and dance about. he told them tales of bees and \n","flowers, the ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the forest, about \n","the evil things and good things, things friendly and things unfriendly, \n","cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles. \n","\n","as they listened, they began to understand the lives of the forest, \n","apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all \n","other things were at home. moving constantly in and out of his talk was old \n","man willow, and frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more \n","than \n","\n","enough, for it was not comfortable lore. tom's words laid bare the hearts of \n","trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with \n","a hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, \n","hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. it was not called the old forest \n","without reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten \n","woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the \n","fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. the \n","countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with \n","malice. but none were more dangerous than the great willow: his heart was \n","rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of \n","winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the \n","river. his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like \n","fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till \n","it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge \n","to the downs. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","suddenly tom's talk left the woods and went leaping up the young \n","stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among \n","small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at last up on to \n","the downs. they heard of the great barrows, and the green mounds, and the \n","stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. sheep were \n","bleating in flocks. green walls and white walls rose. there were fortresses \n","on the heights. kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young sun \n","shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords. there was \n","victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went \n","up into the sky. gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and \n","mounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over \n","all. sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were \n","empty again. a shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were \n","stirred in the mounds. barrow- wights walked in the hollow places with a \n","clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind.' stone rings \n","grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight. \n","\n","the hobbits shuddered. even in the shire the rumour of the \n","barrow- wights of the barrow-downs beyond the forest had been heard. but it \n","was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a comfortable \n","fireside far away. these four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this \n","house had driven from their minds: the house of tom bombadil nestled under \n","the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. they lost the thread of his tale \n","and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another. \n","\n","when they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered \n","into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought, \n","into limes when the world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the \n","western shore; and still on and back tom went singing out into ancient \n","starlight, when only the elf-sires were awake. then suddenly he slopped, and \n","they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep. the hobbits sat still \n","before him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the spell of his words, \n","the wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been \n","withdrawn, and darkness had come from east and west, and all the sky was \n","filled with the light of white stars. \n","\n","whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed \n","frodo could not tell. ele did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled \n","with wonder. the stars shone through the window and the silence of the \n","heavens seemed to be round him. he spoke at last out of his wonder and a \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","sudden fear of that silence: \n","\n","'who are you, master?' he asked. \n","\n","'eh, what?' said tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom. \n","\n","'don't you know my name yet? that's the only answer. tell me, who are you, \n","alone, yourself and nameless? but you are young and i am old. eldest, that's \n","what i am. mark my words, my friends: tom was here before the river and the \n","trees; tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. he made paths \n","before the big people, and saw the little people arriving. he was here \n","before the kings and the graves and the barrow- wights. when the elves passed \n","westward, tom was here already, before the seas were bent. he knew the dark \n","under the stars when it was fearless - before the dark lord came from \n","outside.' \n","\n","a shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily \n","through the panes. when they turned again, goldberry stood in the door \n","behind, framed in light. she held a candle, shielding its flame from the \n","draught with her hand; and the light flowed through it, like sunlight \n","through a white shell. \n","\n","'the rain has ended,' she said; 'and new waters are running downhill, \n","under the stars. let us now laugh and be glad!' \n","\n","'and let us have food and drink!' cried tom. 'long tales are thirsty. \n","\n","and long listening's hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!' with that he \n","jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the \n","chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that goldberry held; then he danced \n","about the table. suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared. \n","\n","quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. then tom and \n","goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in \n","laughter: so fair was the grace of goldberry and so merry and odd the \n","caperings of tom. yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance, \n","neither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the \n","table; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order. \n","\n","the boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. tom bowed to his guests. \n","'supper is ready,' said goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was \n","clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes' \n","mail. but tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and \n","he had green stockings. \n","\n","it was a supper even better than before. the hobbits under the spell of \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","tom's words may have missed one meal or many, but when the food was \n","before \n","\n","them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten. they did not sing or \n","even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. but after \n","a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in \n","mirth and laughter. \n","\n","after they had eaten, goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that \n","began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the \n","silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had \n","known, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like \n","jewels in the depths. then once more she wished them each good night and \n","left them by the fireside. but tom now seemed wide awake and plied them \n","with \n","\n","questions. \n","\n","he appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and \n","indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the shire down from \n","days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves. it no longer surprised \n","them; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to \n","farmer maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance \n","than \n","\n","they had imagined. 'there's earth under his old feet, and clay on his \n","fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,' said tom. it was \n","also clear that tom had dealings with the elves, and it seemed that in some \n","fashion, news had reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo. \n","\n","indeed so much did tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that \n","frodo found himself telling him more about bilbo and his own hopes and fears \n","than he had told before even to gandalf. tom wagged his head up and down, \n","and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the riders. \n","\n","'show me the precious ring!' he said suddenly in the midst of the \n","story: and frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his \n","pocket, and unfastening the ring handed it at once to tom. \n","\n","it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big \n","brown-skinned hand. then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. for a \n","second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright \n","blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. then tom put the ring round the \n","end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. for a moment the \n","hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. then they gasped. there was no \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","sign of tom disappearing! \n","\n","tom laughed again, and then he spun the ring in the air - and it \n","vanished with a flash. frodo gave a cry - and tom leaned forward and handed \n","it back to him with a smile. \n","\n","frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has \n","lent a trinket to a juggler). it was the same ring, or looked the same and \n","weighed the same: for that ring had always seemed to frodo to weigh \n","strangely heavy in the hand. but something prompted him to make sure. he \n","was \n","\n","perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming to make so light of what even \n","gandalf thought so perilously important. he waited for an opportunity, when \n","the talk was going again, and tom was telling an absurd story about badgers \n","and their queer ways - then he slipped the ring on. \n","\n","merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked \n","an exclamation. frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all \n","right, for merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not \n","see him. he got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the \n","outer door. \n","\n","'hey there!' cried tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in \n","his shining eyes. 'hey! come frodo, there! where be you a-going? old tom \n","bombadil's not as blind as that yet. take off your golden ring! your hand's \n","more fair without it. come back! leave your game and sit down beside me! \n","we \n","\n","must talk a while more, and think about the morning. tom must teach the \n","right road, and keep your feet from wandering.' \n","\n","frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the ring he came \n","and sat down again. tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would shine \n","tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful. \n","but they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a \n","thing that even tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change \n","sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. 'i am no weather-master,' \n","he said; 'nor is aught that goes on two legs.' \n","\n","by his advice they decided to make nearly due north from his house, \n","over the western and lower slopes of the downs: they might hope in that way \n","to strike the east road in a day's journey, and avoid the barrows. he told \n","them not to be afraid - but to mind their own business. \n","\n","'keep to the green grass. don't you go a-meddling with old stone or \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","cold wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts \n","that never falter!' he said this more than once; and he advised them to pass \n","barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one. then he \n","taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger \n","or difficulty the next day. \n","\n","ho! tom bombadil, tom bombadillo! \n","\n","by water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow, \n","\n","by fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! \n","\n","come, tom bombadil, for our need is near us! \n","\n","when they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on \n","the shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them back to their \n","bedroom. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 8 . fog on the barrow-downs \n","\n","\n","\n","that night they heard no noises. but either in his dreams or out of \n","them, he could not tell which, frodo heard a sweet singing running in his \n","mind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey \n","rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, \n","until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him \n","under a swift sunrise. \n","\n","the vision melted into waking; and there was tom whistling like a \n","tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and \n","through the open window. outside everything was green and pale gold. \n","\n","after breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say \n","farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool, \n","bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. the air came fresh \n","from the north-west. their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and \n","moving restlessly. tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced \n","upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good \n","speed. \n","\n","they rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and \n","went slanting up towards the north end of the hill -brow under which it \n","sheltered. they had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep \n","slope, when suddenly frodo stopped. \n","\n","'goldberry!' he cried. 'my fair lady, clad all in silver green! we have \n","never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!' he was so \n","distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came \n","rippling down. there on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair \n","was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. a light \n","like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she \n","danced. \n","\n","they hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. they \n","bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked \n","out from the hill-top over lands under the morning. it was now as clear and \n","far-seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in \n","the forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark \n","trees in the west. in that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","yellow, russet under the sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the \n","brandywine. to the south, over the line of the withywindle, there was a \n","distant glint like pale glass where the brandywine river made a great loop \n","in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits. \n","northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and \n","swellings of grey and green and pale earth -colours, until it faded into a \n","featureless and shadowy distance. eastward the barrow-downs rose, ridge \n","behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it \n","was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with \n","the hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of \n","the high and distant mountains. \n","\n","they took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few \n","stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. it seemed fainthearted \n","to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the road, \n","when they should be leaping, as lusty as tom, over the stepping stones of \n","the hills straight towards the mountains. \n","\n","goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. 'speed \n","now, fair guests!' she said. 'and hold to your purpose! north with the wind \n","in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! make haste while the sun \n","shines!' and to frodo she said: 'farewell, elf-friend, it was a merry \n","meeting!' \n","\n","but frodo found no words to answer. he bowed low, and mounted his pony, \n","and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the \n","hill. tom bombadil's house and the valley, and the forest were lost to view. \n","the air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and \n","the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. turning back, when \n","they reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw goldberry, now small \n","and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still \n","watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. as they looked \n","she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished \n","behind the hill . \n","\n","their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet \n","of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the \n","shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth \n","sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys. there was no \n","tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy \n","turf, silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and high lonely cries of strange birds. as they journeyed the sun mounted, \n","and grew hot. each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown \n","less. when they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant forest \n","seemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf \n","and root and mould. a shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze \n","above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy. \n","\n","about mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, \n","like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. inside there was no air \n","stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. they rode across and looked \n","northwards. then their hearts rose, for it seemed plain that they had come \n","further already than they had expected. certainly the distances had now all \n","become hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the downs were \n","coming to an end. a long valley lay below them winding away northwards, \n","until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders. beyond, there \n","seemed to be no more hills. due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark \n","line. that is a line of trees,' said merry, 'and that must mark the road. \n","\n","all along it for many leagues east of the bridge there are trees growing. \n","\n","some say they were planted in the old days.' \n","\n","'splendid!' said frodo. 'if we make as good going this afternoon as we \n","have done this morning, we shall have left the downs before the sun sets and \n","be jogging on in search of a camping place.' but even as he spoke he turned \n","his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and \n","looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds, \n","and on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of \n","green gums. \n","\n","that view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and \n","went down into the hollow circle. in the midst of it there stood a single \n","stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no \n","shadow. it was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding \n","finger, or more like a warning. but they were now hungry, and the sun was \n","still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of \n","the stone. it was cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at \n","that time this seemed pleasant. there they took food and drink, and made as \n","good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came \n","from 'down under hill'. tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of \n","the day. their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass. \n","\n","riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","scent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and \n","looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to \n","explain what happened. however, that may be: they woke suddenly and \n","uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. the standing stone \n","was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them. \n","the sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist just above \n","the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east, \n","beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. the air was silent, heavy \n","and chill. their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads \n","down. \n","\n","the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim. \n","\n","they found that they were upon an island in the fog. even as they looked out \n","in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white \n","sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behind. the fog rolled up \n","to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads \n","until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central \n","pillar was the standing stone. \n","\n","they felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite \n","lose heart. they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line \n","of the road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay. in any \n","case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone \n","that no thought of remaining there was in their minds. they packed up as \n","quickly as their chilled fingers would work. \n","\n","soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and \n","down the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. as they \n","went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and \n","dripping on their foreheads. when they reached the bottom it was so cold \n","that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed \n","with grey drops. then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again, \n","feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. they were steering, as \n","well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end \n","of the long valley which they had seen in the morning. once they were \n","through the gap, they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line \n","and they were bound in the end to strike the road. their thoughts did not go \n","beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs \n","there might be no fog. \n","\n","their going was very slow. to prevent their getting separated and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","wandering in different directions they went in file, with frodo leading. sam \n","was behind him, and after him came pippin, and then merry. the valley \n","seemed \n","\n","to stretch on endlessly. suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign. on either side \n","ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they \n","were at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the \n","barrow-downs. if they could pass that, they would be free. \n","\n","'come on! follow me!' he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried \n","forward. but his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm. the dark \n","patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous \n","before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a \n","headless door, two huge standing stones. he could not remember having seen \n","any sign of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the \n","morning. he had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even \n","as \n","\n","he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. his pony reared and snorted, \n","and he fell off. when he looked back he found that he was alone: the others \n","had not followed him. 'sam!' he called. 'pippin! merry! come along! why \n","don't you keep up?' \n","\n","there was no answer. fear took him, and he ran back past the stones \n","shouting wildly: 'sam! sam! merry! pippin!' the pony bolted into the mist \n","and vanished. from some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: \n","'hoy! frodo! hoy!' it was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the \n","great stones, staring and straining into the gloom. he plunged off in the \n","direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill. \n","\n","as he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more \n","frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint \n","and far ahead and high above him. 'frodo! hoy!' came the thin voices out of \n","the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated, \n","ending with a last help! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut \n","short. he stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries; \n","but the light was now gone, and clinging night had closed about him, so that \n","it was impossible to be sure of any direction. he seemed all the time to be \n","climbing up and up. \n","\n","only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he \n","at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. he was weary, sweating and yet \n","chilled. it was wholly dark. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'where are you?' he cried out miserably. \n","\n","there was no reply. he stood listening. he was suddenly aware that it \n","was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy \n","wind. a change was coming in the weather. the mist was flowing past him \n","now \n","\n","in shreds and tatters. his breath was smoking, and the darkness was less \n","near and thick. he looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were \n","appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog. the wind \n","began to hiss over the grass. \n","\n","he imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards \n","it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and \n","the starry sky was unveiled. a glance showed him that he was now facing \n","southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from the \n","north. out of the east the biting wind was blowing. to his right there \n","loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape. a great barrow stood \n","there. \n","\n","'where are you?' he cried again, both angry and afraid. \n","\n","'here!' said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the \n","ground. 'i am waiting for you!' \n","\n","'no!' said frodo; but he did not run away. his knees gave, and he fell \n","on the ground. nothing happened, and there was no sound. trembling he \n","looked \n","\n","up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars. it \n","leaned over him. he thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a \n","pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance. then a grip \n","stronger and colder than iron seized him. the icy touch froze his bones, and \n","he remembered no more. \n","\n","when he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing \n","except a sense of dread. then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned, \n","caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. a barrow-wight had taken him, and he \n","was probably already under the dreadful spells of the barrow- wights about \n","which whispered tales spoke. he dared not move, but lay as he found himself: \n","flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast. \n","\n","but though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very \n","darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo \n","baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the \n","shire and talking about roads and adventures. there is a seed of courage \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid \n","hobbit, wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow. frodo \n","was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it, \n","\n","bilbo (and gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the shire. he thought \n","he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought \n","hardened him. he found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he no \n","longer felt limp like a helpless prey. \n","\n","as he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all \n","at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was \n","growing round him. it did not at first show him what kind of a place he was \n","in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor \n","beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. he turned, and there \n","in the cold glow he saw lying beside him sam, pippin, and merry. they were \n","on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in \n","white. about them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light \n","they looked cold and unlovely. on their heads were circlets, gold chains \n","were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. swords lay by \n","their sides, and shields were at their feet. but across their three necks \n","lay one long naked sword. \n","\n","suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. the voice \n","seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, \n","sometimes like a low moan from the ground. out of the formless stream of sad \n","but horrible sounds, strings of words would now and again shape themselves: \n","grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. the night was railing \n","against the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the \n","warmth for which it hungered. frodo was chilled to the marrow. after a while \n","the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it \n","had changed into an incantation: \n","\n","cold be hand and heart and bone, \n","\n","and cold be sleep under stone: \n","\n","never mare to wake on stony bed, \n","\n","never, till the sun fails and the moon is dead. \n","\n","in the black wind the stars shall die, \n","and still on gold here let them lie, \n","till the dark lord lifts his hand \n","over dead sea and withered land. \n","\n","he heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. raising himself \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind \n","of passage which behind them turned a corner. round the corner a long arm \n","was groping, walking on its fingers towards sam, who was lying nearest, and \n","towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him. \n","\n","at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the \n","incantation. then a wild thought of escape came to him. he wondered if he \n","put on the ring, whether the barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find \n","some way out. he thought of himself running free over the grass, grieving \n","for merry, and sam, and pippin, but free and alive himself. gandalf would \n","admit that there had been nothing else he could do. \n","\n","but the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he \n","could not leave his friends so easily. he wavered, groping in his pocket, \n","and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer. \n","suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay \n","beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions. \n","with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and \n","the hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the \n","hilt. there was a shriek and the light vanished. in the dark there was a \n","snarling noise. \n","\n","frodo fell forward over merry, and merry's face felt cold. all at once \n","back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of \n","the fog, came the memory of the house down under the hill, and of tom \n","singing. he remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them. in a small \n","desperate voice he began: ho! tom bombadil! and with that name his voice \n","seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber \n","echoed as if to drum and trumpet. \n","\n","ho! tom bombadil, tom bombadillo! \n","\n","by water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow, \n","\n","by fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! \n","\n","come, tom bombadil, for our need is near us! \n","\n","there was a sudden deep silence, in which frodo could hear his heart \n","beating. after a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was \n","coming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice \n","singing: \n","\n","old tom bombadil is a merry fellow, \n","\n","bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow. \n","\n","none has ever caught him yet, for tom, he is the master: \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","his songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster. \n","\n","there was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and \n","suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. a low \n","door -like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond frodo's feet; \n","and there was tom's head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of \n","the sun rising red behind him. the light fell upon the floor, and upon the \n","faces of the three hobbits lying beside frodo. they did not stir, but the \n","sickly hue had left them. they looked now as if they were only very deeply \n","asleep. \n","\n","tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing: \n","\n","get out, you old wight! vanish in the sunlight! \n","\n","shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing, \n","\n","out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains! \n","\n","come never here again! leave your barrow empty! \n","\n","lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness, \n","\n","where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended. \n","\n","at these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber \n","fell in with a crash. then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away \n","into an unguessable distance; and after that silence. \n","\n","'come, friend frodo!' said tom. 'let us get out on to clean grass! you \n","must help me bear them.' \n","\n","together they carried out merry, pippin, and sam. as frodo left the \n","barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, \n","like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. tom went back in again, \n","and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. when he came out he \n","was \n","\n","bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver, \n","copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. he \n","climbed \n","\n","the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine. \n","\n","there he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and \n","looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon \n","the grass at the west side of the mound. raising his right hand he said in a \n","clear and commanding voice: \n","\n","wake now my merry tads! wake and hear me calling! \n","\n","warm now be heart and limb! the cold stone is fallen; \n","\n","dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","night under night is flown, and the gate is open! \n","\n","to frodo's great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed \n","their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. they looked about in amazement, \n","first at frodo, and then at tom standing large as life on the barrow-top \n","above them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and \n","belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets. \n","\n","'what in the name of wonder?' began merry, feeling the golden circlet \n","that had slipped over one eye. then he stopped, and a shadow came over his \n","face, and he closed his eyes. 'of course, i remember!' he said. 'the men of \n","carn dym came on us at night, and we were worsted. ah! the spear in my \n","heart!' he clutched at his breast. 'no! no!' he said, opening his eyes. \n","\n","'what am i saying? i have been dreaming. where did you get to, frodo?' \n","\n","'i thought that i was lost,' said frodo; 'but i don't want to speak of \n","it. let us think of what we are to do now! let us go on!' \n","\n","'dressed up like this, sir?' said sam. 'where are my clothes?' he flung \n","his circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as \n","if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other \n","hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand. \n","\n","'you won't find your clothes again,' said tom, bounding down from the \n","mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight. one would have \n","thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the \n","horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him, and saw the merry \n","glint in his eyes. \n","\n","'what do you mean?' asked pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half \n","amused. 'why not?' \n","\n","but tom shook his head, saying: 'you've found yourselves again, out of \n","the deep water. clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. be \n","glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb! \n","cast off these cold rags! run naked on the grass, while tom goes a-hunting!' \n","\n","he sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. looking down after him \n","frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between \n","their \n","\n","hill and the next, still whistling and crying: \n","\n","hey! now! come hoy now! whither do you wander? \n","\n","up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder? \n","\n","sharp-ears, wise-nose, swish-tail and bumpkin, \n","\n","white-socks my little lad, and old fatty lumpkin! \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","so he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he \n","was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now! \n","came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south. \n","\n","the air was growing very warm again. the hobbits ran about for a while \n","on the grass, as he told them. then they lay basking in the sun with the \n","delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a \n","friendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake \n","one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of \n","promise. \n","\n","by the time that tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). he \n","reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an \n","obedient line six ponies: their own five and one more. the last was plainly \n","old fatty lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their \n","own ponies. merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them \n","any such names, but they answered to the new names that tom had given \n","them \n","\n","for the rest of their lives. tom called them one by one and they climbed \n","over the brow and stood in a line. then tom bowed to the hobbits. \n","\n","'here are your ponies, now!' he said. 'they've more sense (in some \n","ways) than you wandering hobbits have - more sense in their noses. for they \n","sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save \n","themselves, then they run the right way. you must forgive them all; for \n","though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of barrow- wights is not what \n","they were made for. see, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!' \n","\n","merry, sam, and pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from \n","their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on \n","some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the \n","oncoming of winter. \n","\n","'where does that other old animal, that fatty lumpkin, come from?' \n","asked frodo. \n","\n","'he's mine,' said tom. 'my four-legged friend; though i seldom ride \n","him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. when your ponies \n","stayed with me, they got to know my lumpkin; and they smelt him in the \n","night, and quickly ran to meet him. i thought he'd look for them and with \n","his words of wisdom take all their fear away. but now, my jolly lumpkin, old \n","tom's going to ride. hey! he's coming with you, just to set you on the road; \n","so he needs a pony. for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","when you're on your own legs trying to trot beside them.' \n","\n","the hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked tom many times; \n","but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he \n","would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his \n","land. tve got things to do,' he said: 'my making and my singing, my \n","talking and my walking, and my watching of the country. tom can't be always \n","near to open doors and willow-cracks. tom has his house to mind, and \n","goldberry is waiting.' \n","\n","it was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten, \n","and the hobbits turned their minds to food. their last meal had been lunch \n","beside the standing stone the day before. they breakfasted now off the \n","remainder of tom's provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that \n","tom had brought with him. it was not a large meal (considering hobbits and \n","the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. while they were eating \n","tom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures. most of these he \n","made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass. he bade them lie \n","there 'free to all finders, birds, beasts. elves or men, and all kindly \n","creatures'; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and \n","no wight ever come back to it. he chose for himself from the pile a brooch \n","set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue \n","butterflies. he looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his \n","head, and saying at last: \n","\n","'here is a pretty toy for tom and for his lady! fair was she who long \n","ago wore this on her shoulder. goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not \n","forget her!' \n","\n","for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, \n","of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. \n","they \n","\n","gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange \n","metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. whether by some \n","virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the \n","blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun. \n","\n","'old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,' he said. \n","\n","'sharp blades are good to have, if shire-folk go walking, east, south, or \n","far away into dark and danger.' then he told them that these blades were \n","forged many long years ago by men of westernesse: they were foes of the \n","dark \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of carn dym in the land of \n","angmar. \n","\n","'few now remember them,' tom murmured, 'yet still some go wandering, \n","sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things \n","folk that are heedless.' \n","\n","the hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a \n","vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast \n","shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of men, tall and grim with \n","bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. then the vision \n","faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. it was time to start again. \n","\n","they made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. their new \n","weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them \n","very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. fighting had not \n","before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their \n","flight would land them. \n","\n","at last they set off. they led their ponies down the hill; and then \n","mounting they trotted quickly along the valley. they looked back and saw the \n","top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went \n","up like a yellow flame. then they turned a shoulder of the downs and it was \n","hidden from view. \n","\n","though frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great \n","stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap \n","and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. it was a merry \n","journey with tom bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on \n","fatty lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. tom \n","sang \n","\n","most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange \n","language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were \n","mainly \n","\n","those of wonder and delight. \n","\n","they went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the road was further \n","away than they had imagined. even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day \n","would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day \n","before. the dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of \n","bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further \n","side. tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very \n","long lime ago. he seemed to remember something sad about it, and would not \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","say much. \n","\n","they climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, \n","and then tom turned due north, for they had been bearing somewhat to the \n","west. the land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, \n","but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall \n","trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the road after many \n","unexpected adventures. they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs, \n","and halted under the long shadows of the trees. they were on the top of a \n","sloping bank, and the road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away \n","below \n","\n","them. at this point it ran nearly from south-west to north-east, and on \n","their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. it was rutted and bore \n","many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of \n","water. they rode down the bank and looked up and down. there was nothing \n","to \n","\n","be seen. 'well, here we are again at last!' said frodo. 'i suppose we \n","haven't lost more than two days by my short cut through the forest! but \n","perhaps the delay will prove useful - it may have put them off our trail.' \n","\n","the others looked at him. the shadow of the fear of the black riders \n","came suddenly over them again. ever since they had entered the forest they \n","had thought chiefly of getting back to the road; only now when it lay \n","beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was \n","more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the road itself. they \n","looked anxiously back towards the setting sun, but the road was brown and \n","empty. \n","\n","'do you think,' asked pippin hesitatingly, 'do you think we may be \n","pursued, tonight?' \n","\n","'no, i hope not tonight,' answered tom bombadil; 'nor perhaps the next \n","day. but do not trust my guess; for i cannot tell for certain. out east my \n","knowledge fails. tom is not master of riders from the black land far beyond \n","his country.' \n","\n","all the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. they felt that \n","he would know how to deal with black riders, if anyone did. they would \n","soon \n","\n","now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but \n","the most vague and distant legends of the shire, and in the gathering \n","twilight they longed for home. a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","them. they stood silent, reluctant to make the final parting, and only \n","slowly became aware that tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to \n","have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting. \n","\n","'tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your \n","own luck must go with you and guide you): four miles along the road you'll \n","come upon a village, bree under bree-hill, with doors looking westward. \n","there you'll find an old inn that is called the prancing pony. barliman \n","butterbur is the worthy keeper. there you can stay the night, and afterwards \n","the morning will speed you upon your way. be bold, but wary! keep up your \n","merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!' \n","\n","they begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more \n","with them; but he laughed and refused, saying: \n","\n","tom's country ends here: he will not pass the borders. \n","\n","tom has his house to mind, and goldberry is waiting! \n","\n","then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on lumpkin's back, and rode \n","up over the bank and away singing into the dusk. \n","\n","the hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight. \n","\n","'i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil,' said sam. 'he's a \n","caution and no mistake. i reckon we may go a good deal further and see \n","naught better, nor queerer. but i won't deny i'll be glad to see this \n","prancing pony he spoke of. i hope it'll be like the green dragon away back \n","home! what sort of folk are they in bree?' \n","\n","'there are hobbits in bree,' said merry, 'as well as big folk. i \n","daresay it will be homelike enough. the pony is a good inn by all accounts. \n","\n","my people ride out there now and again.' \n","\n","'it may be all we could wish,' said frodo; 'but it is outside the shire \n","all the same. don't make yourselves too much at home ! please remember -all \n","of you - that the name of baggins must not be mentioned. i am mr. underhill, \n","if any name must be given.' \n","\n","they now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening. \n","darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again, \n","until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead. \n","\n","before them rose bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against misty \n","stars; and under its western flank nestled a large village. towards it they \n","now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a door between them and the \n","night. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 9 . at the sign of \n","\n","\n","\n","the prancing pony \n","\n","bree was the chief village of the bree-land, a small inhabited region, \n","like an island in the empty lands round about. besides bree itself, there \n","was staddle on the other side of the hill, combe in a deep valley a little \n","further eastward, and archet on the edge of the chetwood. lying round \n","bree-hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland \n","only a few miles broad. \n","\n","the men of bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short, cheerful \n","and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves; but they were more \n","friendly and familiar with hobbits, dwarves, elves, and other inhabitants of \n","the world about them than was (or is) usual with big people. according to \n","their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants \n","of the first men that ever wandered into the west of the middle-world. few \n","had survived the turmoils of the elder days; but when the kings returned \n","again over the great sea they had found the bree-men still there, and they \n","were still there now, when the memory of the old kings had faded into the \n","grass. \n","\n","in those days no other men had settled dwellings so far west, or within \n","a hundred leagues of the shire. but in the wild lands beyond bree there were \n","mysterious wanderers. the bree-folk called them rangers, and knew nothing \n","of \n","\n","their origin. they were taller and darker than the men of bree and were \n","believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the \n","languages of beasts and birds. they roamed at will southwards, and eastwards \n","even as far as the misty mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen. \n","when they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten \n","tales which were eagerly listened to; but the bree-folk did not make friends \n","of them. \n","\n","there were also many families of hobbits in the bree-land and they \n","claimed to be the oldest settlement of hobbits in the world, one that was \n","founded long before even the brandywine was crossed and the shire colonized. \n","they lived mostly in staddle though there were some in bree itself, \n","especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the men. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the big folk and the little folk (as they called one another) were on \n","friendly terms, minding their own affairs in their own ways, but both \n","rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the bree-folk. nowhere \n","else in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found. \n","\n","the bree-folk, big and little, did not themselves travel much; and the \n","affairs of the four villages were their chief concern. occasionally the \n","hobbits of bree went as far as buckland, or the eastfarthing; but though \n","their link land was not much further than a day's riding east of the \n","brandywine bridge, the hobbits of the shire now seldom visited it. an \n","occasional bucklander or adventurous took would come out to the inn for a \n","night or two, but even that was becoming less and less usual. the \n","shire-hobbits referred to those of bree, and to any others that lived beyond \n","the borders, as outsiders, and took very little interest in them, \n","considering them dull and uncouth. there were probably many more \n","outsiders \n","\n","scattered about in the west of the world in those days than the people of \n","the shire imagined. some, doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to \n","dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them. but in the \n","bree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no more \n","rustic than most of their distant relatives inside. it was not yet forgotten \n","that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between \n","the \n","\n","shire and bree. there was bree-blood in the brandybucks by all accounts. \n","\n","the village of bree had some hundred stone houses of the big folk, \n","mostly above the road, nestling on the hillside with windows looking west. \n","on that side, running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to \n","it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side. over this \n","the road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred \n","by a great gate. there was another gate in the southern comer where the road \n","ran out of the village. the gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside \n","them were small lodges for the gatekeepers. \n","\n","down on the road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of \n","the hill, there was a large inn. it had been built long ago when the traffic \n","on the roads had been far greater. for bree stood at an old meeting of ways; \n","another ancient road crossed the east road just outside (he dike at the \n","western end of the village, and in former days men and other folk of various \n","sorts had travelled much on it. strange as news from bree was still a saying \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","in the eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from north, \n","south, and east could be heard in the inn, and when the shire-hobbits used \n","to go more often to hear it. but the northern lands had long been desolate, \n","and the north road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the \n","bree-folk called it the greenway. \n","\n","the inn of bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an \n","important person. his house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and \n","inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of the four villages; \n","and a resort of rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly \n","dwarves) as still journeyed on the east road, to and from the mountains. \n","\n","it was dark, and white stars were shining, when frodo and his \n","companions came at last to the greenway-crossing and drew near the village. \n","they came to the west-gate and found it shut, but at the door of the lodge \n","beyond it, there was a man sitting. he jumped up and fetched a lantern and \n","looked over the gate at them in surprise. \n","\n","'what do you want, and where do you come from?' he asked gruffly. \n","\n","'we are making for the inn here,' answered frodo. 'we are journeying \n","east and cannot go further tonight.' \n","\n","'hobbits ! four hobbits ! and what's more, out of the shire by their \n","talk,' said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. he stared at \n","them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride \n","through. \n","\n","'we don't often see shire-folk riding on the road at night,' he went \n","on, as they halted a moment by his door. 'you'll pardon my wondering what \n","business takes you away east of bree! what may your names be, might i ask?' \n","\n","'our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good \n","place to discuss them,' said frodo, not liking the look of the man or the \n","tone of his voice. \n","\n","'your business is your own, no doubt,' said the man; 'but it's my \n","business to ask questions after nightfall.' \n","\n","'we are hobbits from buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to \n","stay at the inn here,' put in merry. 'i am mr. brandybuck. is that enough \n","for you? the bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so i had \n","heard.' \n","\n","'all right, all right!' said the man. 'i meant no offence. but you'll \n","find maybe that more folk than old harry at the gate will be asking you \n","questions. there's queer folk about. if you go on to the pony, you'll find \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","you're oat the only guests.' \n","\n","he wished them good night, and they said no more; but frodo could see \n","in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them curiously. he was \n","glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward. he \n","wondered why the man was so suspicious, and whether any one had been \n","asking \n","\n","for news of a party of hobbits. could it have been gandalf? he might have \n","arrived, while they were delayed in the forest and the downs. but there was \n","something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy. \n","\n","the man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to \n","his house. as soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in \n","over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street. \n","\n","the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, \n","and drew up outside the inn. the houses looked large and strange to them. \n","sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt \n","his heart sink. he had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees, \n","and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course \n","of his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of men and \n","their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring \n","day. he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the \n","inn-yard, and black riders peering out of dark upper windows. \n","\n","'we surely aren't going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?' he \n","exclaimed. 'if there are hobbit-folk in these pans, why don't we look for \n","some that would be willing to take us in? it would be more homelike.' \n","\n","'what's wrong with the inn?' said frodo. 'tom bombadil recommended it. \n","i expect it's homelike enough inside.' \n","\n","even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. \n","\n","it had a front on the road, and two wings running back on land partly cut \n","out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor \n","windows were level with the ground. there was a wide arch leading to a \n","courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a \n","large doorway reached by a few broad steps. the door was open and light \n","streamed out of it. above the arch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a \n","large signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs. over the door \n","was painted in white letters: the prancing pony by barliman \n","butterbur. many \n","\n","of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","as they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry \n","song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. they \n","listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their \n","ponies. the song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping. \n","\n","they led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the \n","yard they climbed up the steps. frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a \n","short fat man with a bald head and a red face. he had a white apron on, and \n","was bustling out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden \n","with full mugs. \n","\n","'can we-' began frodo. \n","\n","'half a minute, if you please!' shouted the man over his shoulder, and \n","vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. in a moment he was out \n","again, wiping his hands on his apron. \n","\n","'good evening, little master!' he said, bending down. 'what may you be \n","wanting?' \n","\n","'beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed. \n","\n","are you mr. butterbur?' \n","\n","'that's right! barliman is my name. barliman butterbur at your service! \n","you're from the shire, eh?' he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand \n","to his forehead, as if trying to remember something. 'hobbits!' he cried. \n","\n","'now what does that remind me of? might i ask your names, sir?' \n","\n","'mr. took and mr. brandybuck,' said frodo; 'and this is sam gamgee. my \n","name is underhill.' \n","\n","'there now!' said mr. butterbur, snapping his fingers. 'it's gone \n","again! but it'll come back, when i have time to think. i'm run off my feet; \n","but i'll see what i can do for you. we don't often get a party out of the \n","shire nowadays, and i should be sorry not to make you welcome. but there is \n","such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn't been for long \n","enough. it never rains but it pours, we say in bree. \n","\n","'hi! nob!' he shouted. 'where are you, you woolly -footed slow-coach? \n","nob!' \n","\n","'coming, sir! coming!' a cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, \n","and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great \n","interest. \n","\n","'where's bob?' asked the landlord. 'you don't know? well find him! \n","double sharp! i haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither! tell bob there's \n","five ponies that have to be stabled. he must find room somehow.' nob trotted \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","off with a grin and a wink. \n","\n","'well, now, what was i going to say?' said mr. butterbur, tapping his \n","forehead. 'one thing drives out another, so to speak. i'm that busy tonight, \n","my head is going round. there's a party that came up the greenway from \n","down \n","\n","south last night - and that was strange enough to begin with. then there's a \n","travelling company of dwarves going west come in this evening. and now \n","there's you. if you weren't hobbits, i doubt if we could house you. but \n","we've got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for \n","hobbits, when this place was built. on the ground floor as they usually \n","prefer; round windows and all as they like it. i hope you'll be comfortable. \n","you'll be wanting supper, i don't doubt. as soon as may be. this way now!' \n","\n","he led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. 'here is a \n","nice little parlour!' he said. 'i hope it will suit. excuse me now. i'm that \n","busy. no time for talking. i must be trotting. it's hard work for two legs, \n","but i don't get thinner. i'll look in again later. if you want anything, \n","ring the hand-bell, and nob will come. if he don't come, ring and shout!' \n","\n","off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. he seemed \n","capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he might be. they found \n","themselves in a small and cosy room. there was a bit of bright fire burning \n","on the hearth, and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs. \n","there was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a \n","large hand-bell. but nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before \n","they thought of ringing. he brought candles and a tray full of plates. \n","\n","'will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?' he asked. 'and shall \n","i show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?' \n","\n","they were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when mr. \n","butterbur and nob came in again. in a twinkling the table was laid. there \n","was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter, \n","and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as the shire could show, \n","and homelike enough to dispel the last of sam's misgivings (already much \n","relieved by the excellence of the beer). \n","\n","the landlord hovered round for a link, and then prepared to leave them. \n","\n","'i don't know whether you would care to join the company, when you have \n","supped,' he said, standing at the door. 'perhaps you would rather go to your \n","beds. still the company would be very pleased to welcome you, if you had a \n","mind. we don't get outsiders - travellers from the shire, i should say, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","begging your pardon - often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story \n","or song you may have in mind. but as you please! ring the bell, if you lack \n","anything!' \n","\n","so refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper \n","(about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary \n","talk) that frodo, pippin, and sam decided to join the company. merry said it \n","would be too stuffy. 'i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and \n","perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. mind your ps and qs, and don't \n","forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still on the \n","high-road and not very far from the shire!' \n","\n","'all right!' said pippin. 'mind yourself! don't get lost, and don't \n","forget that it is safer indoors!' \n","\n","the company was in the big common-room of the inn. the gathering was \n","large and mixed, as frodo discovered, when his eyes got used to the light. \n","\n","this came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from \n","the beams were dim, and half veiled in smoke. barliman butterbur was \n","standing near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two \n","strange-looking men. on the benches were various folk: men of bree, a \n","collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more \n","dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows \n","and comers. \n","\n","as soon as the shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome \n","from the bree-landers. the strangers, especially those that had come up the \n","greenway, stared at them curiously. the landlord introduced the newcomers to \n","the bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were \n","seldom sure who the names belonged to. the men of bree seemed all to have \n","rather botanical (and to the shire-folk rather odd) names, like rushlight, \n","goatleaf, heathertoes, appledore, thistlewool and ferny (not to mention \n","butterbur). some of the hobbits had similar names. the mug worts, for \n","instance, seemed numerous. but most of them had natural names, such as \n","banks, brockhouse, longholes, sandheaver, and tunnelly, many of which \n","were \n","\n","used in the shire. there were several underhills from saddle, and as they \n","could not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took frodo to \n","their hearts as a long-lost cousin. \n","\n","the bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and frodo \n","soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","given. he gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which \n","there was much wagging of heads, although neither of these words were much \n","used in the bree-dialect). he said he was thinking of writing a book (at \n","which there was silent astonishment), and that he and his friends wanted to \n","collect information about hobbits living outside the shire, especially in \n","the eastern lands. \n","\n","at this a chorus of voices broke out. if frodo had really wanted to \n","write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned enough for \n","several chapters in a few minutes. and if that was not enough, he was given \n","a whole list of names, beginning with 'old barliman here', to whom he could \n","go for further information. but after a time, as frodo did not show any sign \n","of writing a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about \n","doings in the shire. frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon \n","found himself sitting alone in a comer, listening and looking around. \n","\n","the men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling \n","flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. there was trouble away \n","in the south, and it seemed that the men who had come up the greenway \n","were \n","\n","on the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. the \n","bree-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large \n","number of strangers into their little land. one of the travellers, a \n","squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more and more people \n","would be coming north in the near future. 'if room isn't found for them, \n","they'll find it for themselves. they've a right to live, same as other \n","folk,' he said loudly. the local inhabitants did not look pleased at the \n","prospect. \n","\n","the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, and it did not at \n","the moment seem to concern hobbits. big folk could hardly beg for lodgings \n","in hobbit-holes. they were more interested in sam and pippin, who were now \n","feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the shire. \n","pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the \n","roof of the town hole in michel delving: will whitfoot, the mayor, and the \n","fattest hobbit in the westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out \n","like a floured dumpling. but there were several questions asked that made \n","frodo a little uneasy. one of the bree-landers, who seemed to have been in \n","the shire several times, wanted to know where the underhills lived and who \n","they were related to. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","suddenly frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, \n","sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently to the \n","hobbit-talk. he had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a \n","long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. his legs were stretched out before him, \n","showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much \n","wear and were now caked with mud. a travel -stained cloak of heavy dark- \n","green \n","\n","cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he \n","wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be \n","seen as he watched the hobbits. \n","\n","'who is that?' frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to mr. \n","butterbur. 'i don't think you introduced him?' \n","\n","'him?' said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye \n","without turning his head. 'i don't rightly know. he is one of the wandering \n","folk -rangers we call them. he seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare \n","tale when he has the mind. he disappears for a month, or a year, and then he \n","pops up again. he was in and out pretty often last spring; but i haven't \n","seen him about lately. what his right name is i've never heard: but he's \n","known round here as strider. goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; \n","though he don't tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. but there's no \n","accounting for east and west, as we say in bree, meaning the rangers and the \n","shire-folk, begging your pardon. funny you should ask about him.' but at \n","that moment mr. butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his \n","last remark remained unexplained. \n","\n","frodo found that strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard or \n","guessed all that had been said. presently, with a wave of his hand and a \n","nod, he invited frodo to come over and sit by him. as frodo drew near be \n","threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey, \n","and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes. \n","\n","'i am called strider,' he said in a low voice. 'i am very pleased to \n","meet you. master - underhill, if old butterbur got your name right.' \n","\n","'he did,' said frodo stiffly. he felt far from comfortable under the \n","stare of those keen eyes. \n","\n","'well, master underhill,' said strider, 'if i were you, i should stop \n","your young friends from talking too much. drink, fire, and chance -meeting \n","are pleasant enough, but, well - this isn't the shire. there are queer folk \n","about. though i say it as shouldn't, you may think,' he added with a wry \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","smile, seeing frodo's glance. 'and there have been even stranger travellers \n","through bree lately,' he went on, watching frodo's face. \n","\n","frodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and strider made no further \n","sign. his attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on pippin. to his alarm \n","frodo became aware that the ridiculous young took, encouraged by his success \n","with the fat mayor of michel delving, was now actually giving a comic \n","account of bilbo's farewell party. he was already giving an imitation of the \n","speech, and was drawing near to the astonishing disappearance. \n","\n","frodo was annoyed. it was a harmless enough tale for most of the local \n","hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond \n","the river; but some (old butterbur, for instance) knew a thing or two, and \n","had probably heard rumours long ago about bilbo's vanishing. it would bring \n","the name of baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries \n","in bree after that name. \n","\n","frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. pippin was evidently much \n","enjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite forgetful of \n","their danger. frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even \n","mention the ring; and that might well be disastrous. \n","\n","'you had better do something quick!' whispered strider in his ear. \n","\n","frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. the attention \n","of pippin's audience was disturbed. some of the hobbits looked at frodo and \n","laughed and clapped, thinking that mr. underhill had taken as much ale as \n","was good for him. \n","\n","frodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit \n","when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. he felt the ring \n","on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on \n","and vanish out of the silly situation. it seemed to him, somehow, as if me \n","suggestion came to him from outside, from someone or something a the room. \n","he resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped the ring in his hand, as if \n","to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. at \n","any rate it gave him no inspiration. he spoke 'a few suitable words', as \n","they would have said in the shire: we are all very much gratified by the \n","kindness of your reception, and i venture to hope that my brief visit will \n","help to renew the old ties of friendship between the shire and bree; and \n","then he hesitated and coughed. \n","\n","everyone in the room was now looking at him. 'a song!' shouted one of \n","the hobbits. 'a song! a song!' shouted all the others. 'come on now, master, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","sing us something that we haven't heard before!' \n","\n","for a moment frodo stood gaping. then in desperation he began a \n","ridiculous song that bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud \n","of, for he had made up the words himself). it was about an inn; and that is \n","probably why it came into frodo's mind just then. here it is in full. only a \n","few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered. \n","\n","there is an inn, a merry old inn \n","beneath an old grey hill, \n","\n","and there they brew a beer so brown \n","that the man in the moon himself came down \n","one night to drink his fill. \n","\n","the ostler has a tipsy cat \n","that plays a five-stringed fiddle; \n","\n","and up and down he runs his bow, \n","\n","now squeaking high, now purring low, \n","now sawing in the middle. \n","\n","the landlord keeps a little dog \n","that is mighty fond of jokes; \n","\n","when there's good cheer among the guests, \n","\n","he cocks an ear at all the jests \n","and laughs until he chokes. \n","\n","they also keep a horned cow \n","as proud as any queen; \n","\n","but music turns her head like ale, \n","\n","and makes her wave her tufted tail \n","and dance upon the green. \n","\n","and o! the rows of silver dishes \n","and the store of silver spoons! \n","\n","for sunday* there's a special pair, \n","\n","and these they polish up with care \n","on saturday afternoons. \n","\n","\n","\n","the man in the moon was drinking deep, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and the cat began to wail; \n","\n","a dish and a spoon on the table danced, \n","\n","the cow in the garden madly pranced, \n","and the little dog chased his tail. \n","\n","the man in the moon took another mug, \n","and then rolled beneath his chair; \n","\n","and there he dozed and dreamed of ale, \n","\n","till in the sky the stars were pale, \n","and dawn was in the air. \n","\n","then the ostler said to his tipsy cat: \n","\n","'the white horses of the moon, \n","\n","they neigh and champ their silver bits; \n","\n","but their master's been and drowned his wits, \n","and the sun'll be rising soon!' \n","\n","so the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle, \n","a jig that would wake the dead: \n","\n","he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune, \n","while the landlord shook the man in the moon: \n","'it's after three!' he said. \n","\n","they rolled the man slowly up the hill \n","and bundled him into the moon, \n","\n","while his horses galloped up in rear, \n","\n","and the cow came capering like a deer, \n","and a dish ran up with the spoon. \n","\n","now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle; \n","the dog began to roar, \n","\n","the cow and the horses stood on their heads; \n","\n","the guests all bounded from their beds \n","and danced upon the floor. \n","\n","with a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke! \n","the cow jumped over the moon, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and the little dog laughed to see such fun, \n","\n","and the saturday dish went off at a run \n","with the silver sunday spoon. \n","\n","the round moon rolled behind the hill \n","as the sun raised up her head. \n","\n","she * hardly believed her fiery eyes; \n","\n","for though it was day, to her surprise \n","they all went back to bed! \n","\n","there was loud and long applause. frodo had a good voice, and the song \n","tickled their fancy. 'where's old barley?' they cried. 'he ought to hear \n","this. bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and then we'd have a dance.' \n","\n","they called for more ale, and began to shout: 'let's have it again, master! \n","come on now! once more!' \n","\n","they made frodo have another drink, and then begin his song again, \n","while many of them joined in; for the tune was well known, and they were \n","quick at picking up words. it was now frodo's turn to feel pleased with \n","himself. he capered about on the table; and when he came a second time to \n","the cow jumped over the moon, he leaped in the air. much too vigorously; for \n","he came down, bang, into a tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off \n","the table with a crash, clatter, and bump! the audience all opened their \n","mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short a gaping silence; for the singer \n","disappeared. he simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor \n","without leaving a hole ! \n","\n","the local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet \n","and shouted for barliman. all the company drew away from pippin and sam, \n","who \n","\n","found themselves left alone in a comer, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from \n","a distance. it was plain that many people regarded them now as the \n","companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. but \n","there \n","\n","was one swarthy bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and \n","half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. presently he \n","slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had \n","been whispering together a good deal during the evening. harry the \n","gatekeeper also went out just behind them.. \n","\n","frodo felt a fool. not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the tables to the dark comer by strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of \n","his thoughts. frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the ring. how \n","it came to be on his finger he could not tell. he could only suppose that he \n","had been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and that somehow it had \n","slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall. for a \n","moment he wondered if the ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it \n","had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt \n","in the room. he did not like the looks of the men that had gone out. \n","\n","'well?' said strider, when he reappeared. 'why did you do that? worse \n","than anything your friends could have said! you have put your foot in it! or \n","should i say your finger?' \n","\n","'i don't know what you mean,' said frodo, annoyed and alarmed. \n","\n","'oh yes, you do,' answered strider; 'but we had better wait until the \n","uproar has died down. then, if you please, mr. baggins, i should like a \n","quiet word with you.' \n","\n","'what about?' asked frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name. \n","\n","'a matter of some importance - to us both,' answered strider, looking \n","frodo in the eye. 'you may hear something to your advantage.' \n","\n","'very well,' said frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. 'i'll talk to \n","you later.' \n","\n","meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. mr. butterbur had \n","come trotting in, and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting \n","accounts of the event at the same time. \n","\n","'i saw him, mr. butterbur,' said a hobbit; 'or leastways i didn't see \n","him, if you take my meaning. he just vanished into thin air, in a manner of \n","speaking.' \n","\n","'you don't say, mr. mugwort!' said the landlord, looking puzzled. \n","\n","'yes i do!' replied mugwort. 'and i mean what i say, what's more.' \n","\n","'there's some mistake somewhere,' said butterbur, shaking his head. \n","there was too much of that mr. underhill to go vanishing into thin air; or \n","into thick air, as is more likely in this room.' \n","\n","'well, where is he now?' cried several voices. \n","\n","'how should i know? he's welcome to go where he will, so long as he \n","pays in the morning. there's mr. took, now: he's not vanished.' \n","\n","'well, i saw what i saw, and i saw what i didn't,' said mugwort \n","obstinately. \n","\n","'and i say there's some mistake,' repeated butterbur, picking up the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","tray and gathering up the broken crockery. \n","\n","'of course there's a mistake!' said frodo. 'i haven't vanished. here i \n","am! i've just been having a few words with strider in the comer.' \n","\n","he came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed \n","away,, even more perturbed than before. they were not in the least satisfied \n","by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after \n","he had fallen. most of the hobbits and the men of bree went off then and \n","there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that evening. one \n","or two gave frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves. \n","\n","the \n","\n","dwarves and the two or three strange men that still remained got up and said \n","good night to the landlord, but not to frodo and his friends. before long no \n","one was left but strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall. \n","\n","mr. butterbur did not seem much put out. he reckoned, very probably, \n","that his house would be full again on many future nights, until the present \n","mystery had been thoroughly discussed. 'now what have you been doing, mr. \n","underhill?' he asked. 'frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks \n","with your acrobatics!' \n","\n","'i am very sorry to have caused any trouble,' said frodo. 'it was quite \n","unintentional, i assure you. a most unfortunate accident.' \n","\n","'all right, mr. underhill! but if you're going to do any more tumbling, \n","or conjuring, or whatever it was, you'd best warn folk beforehand - and warn \n","me. we're a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way -uncanny, \n","if you understand me; and we don't take to it all of a sudden.' \n","\n","'i shan't be doing anything of the sort again, mr. butterbur, i promise \n","you. and now i think i'll be getting to bed. we shall be making an early \n","start. will you see that our ponies are ready by eight o'clock?' \n","\n","'very good! but before you go, i should like a word with you in \n","private, mr. underhill. something has just come back to my mind that i ought \n","to tell you. i hope that you'll not take it amiss. when i've seen to a thing \n","or two, i'll come along to your room, if you're willing.' \n","\n","'certainly!' said frodo; but his heart sank. he wondered how many \n","private talks he would have before he got to bed, and what they would \n","reveal. were these people all in league against him? he began to suspect \n","even old butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 10. strider \n","\n","\n","\n","frodo, pippin, and sam made their way back to the parlour. there was no \n","light. merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. it was not until \n","they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots \n","that they discovered strider had come with them. there he was calmly sitting \n","in a chair by the door! \n","\n","'hallo!' said pippin. 'who are you, and what do you want?' \n","\n","'i am called strider,' he answered: 'and though he may have forgotten \n","it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.' \n","\n","'you said i might hear something to my advantage, i believe,' said \n","frodo. 'what have you to say?' \n","\n","'several things,' answered strider. 'but, of course, i have my price.' \n","\n","'what do you mean?' asked frodo sharply. \n","\n","'don't be alarmed! i mean just this: i will tell you what i know, and \n","give you some good advice - but i shall want a reward.' \n","\n","'and what will that be, pray?' said frodo. he suspected now that he had \n","fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought \n","only a little money with him. all of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he \n","could not spare any of it. \n","\n","'no more than you can afford,' answered strider with a slow smile, as \n","if he guessed frodo's thoughts. 'just this: you must take me along with you, \n","until i wish to leave you.' \n","\n","'oh, indeed!' replied frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. 'even if \n","i wanted another companion, i should not agree to any such thing, until i \n","knew a good deal more about you, and your business.' \n","\n","'excellent!' exclaimed strider, crossing his legs and sitting back \n","comfortably. 'you seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to \n","the good. you have been much too careless so far. very well! i will tell you \n","what i know, and leave the reward to you. you may be glad to grant it, when \n","you have heard me.' \n","\n","'go on then!' said frodo. 'what do you know?' \n","\n","'too much; too many dark things,' said strider grimly. 'but as for your \n","business - ' he got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked \n","out. then he shut it quietly and sat down again. 'i have quick ears,' he \n","went on, lowering his voice, 'and though i cannot disappear, i have hunted \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","many wild and wary things and i can usually avoid being seen, if i wish. \n","now, i was behind the hedge this evening on the road west of bree, when four \n","hobbits came out of the downlands. i need not repeat all that they said to \n","old bombadil or to one another, but one thing interested me. please \n","remember, said one of them, that the name baggins must not be mentioned. i \n","am mr. underhill, if any name must be given. that interested me so much that \n","i followed them here. i slipped over the gate just behind them. maybe mr. \n","baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, i \n","should advise him and his friends to be more careful.' \n","\n","'i don't see what interest my name has for any one in bree,' said frodo \n","angrily, 'and i have still to learn why it interests you. mr. strider may \n","have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, i should \n","advise him to explain it.' \n","\n","'well answered!' said strider laughing. 'but the explanation is simple: \n","\n","i was looking for a hobbit called frodo baggins. i wanted to find him \n","quickly. i had learned that he was carrying out of the shire, well, a secret \n","that concerned me and my friends. \n","\n","'now, don't mistake me!' he cried, as frodo rose from his seat, and sam \n","jumped up with a scowl. 'i shall take more care of the secret than you do. \n","\n","and care is needed!' he leaned forward and looked at them. 'watch every \n","shadow!' he said in a low voice. 'black horsemen have passed through bree. \n","on monday one came down the greenway, they say; and another appeared \n","later, \n","\n","coming up the greenway from the south.' \n","\n","there was a silence. at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam: 'i ought to \n","have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,' he said. 'and the \n","landlord seems to have heard something. why did he press us to join the \n","company? and why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have \n","stayed quiet in here.' \n","\n","'it would have been better,' said strider. 'i would have stopped your \n","going into the common-room, if i could; but the innkeeper would not let me \n","in to see you, or take a message.' \n","\n","'do you think he ' began frodo. \n","\n","'no, i don't think any harm of old butterbur. only he does not \n","altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.' frodo gave him a puzzled \n","look. 'well, i have rather a rascally look, have i not?' said strider with a \n","curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. 'but i hope we shall get to \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","know one another better. when we do, i hope you will explain what happened \n","at the end of your song. for that little prank ' \n","\n","'it was sheer accident!' interrupted frodo. \n","\n","'i wonder,' said strider. 'accident, then. that accident has made your \n","position dangerous.' \n","\n","'hardly more than it was already,' said frodo. 'i knew these horsemen \n","were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to \n","have gone away.' \n","\n","'you must not count on that!' said strider sharply. 'they will return. \n","\n","and more are coming. there are others. i know their number. i know these \n","riders.' he paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. 'and there are some \n","folk in bree who are not to be trusted,' he went on. 'bill ferny, for \n","instance. he has an evil name in the bree-land, and queer folk call at his \n","house. you must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering \n","fellow. he was very close with one of the southern strangers, and they \n","slipped out together just after your \"accident\". not all of those \n","southerners mean well; and as for ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; \n","or make mischief for amusement.' \n","\n","'what will ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?' \n","said frodo, still determined not to understand strider's hints. \n","\n","'news of you, of course,' answered strider. 'an account of your \n","performance would be very interesting to certain people. after that they \n","would hardly need to be told your real name. it seems to me only too likely \n","that they will hear of it before this night is over. is that enough? you can \n","do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. but i may say \n","that i know all the lands between the shire and the misty mountains, for i \n","have wandered over them for many years. i am older than i look. i might \n","prove useful. you will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the \n","horsemen will watch it night and day. you may escape from bree, and be \n","allowed to go forward while the sun is up; but you won't go far. they will \n","come on you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. do you \n","wish them to find you? they are terrible!' \n","\n","the hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was \n","drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair. the \n","room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. for a \n","while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening \n","to sounds in the night far away. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'there!' he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. \n","'perhaps i know more about these pursuers than you do. you fear them, but \n","you do not fear them enough, yet. tomorrow you will have to escape, if you \n","can. strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. will you have \n","him?' \n","\n","there was a heavy silence. frodo made no answer, his mind was confused \n","with doubt and fear. sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he \n","broke out: \n","\n","'with your leave, mr. frodo, i'd say no! this strider here, he warns \n","and he says take care; and i say yes to that, and let's begin with him. he \n","comes out of the wild, and i never heard no good of such folk. he knows \n","something, that's plain, and more than i like; but it's no reason why we \n","should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he \n","puts it.' \n","\n","pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. strider did not reply to sam, \n","but turned his keen eyes on frodo. frodo caught his glance and looked away. \n","'no,' he said slowly. 'i don't agree. i think, i think you are not really as \n","you choose to look. you began to talk to me like the bree-folk, but your \n","voice has changed. still sam seems right in this: i don't see why you should \n","warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. why the disguise? \n","who are you? what do you really know about - about my business; and how \n","do \n","\n","you know it?' \n","\n","'the lesson in caution has been well learned,' said strider with a grim \n","smile. 'but caution is one thing and wavering is another. you will never get \n","to rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. you must \n","make up your mind. i will answer some of your questions, if that will help \n","you to do so. but why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me \n","already? still here it is ' \n","\n","at that moment there came a knock at the door. mr. butterbur had \n","arrived with candles, and behind him was nob with cans of hot water. strider \n","withdrew into a dark corner. \n","\n","'i've come to bid you good night,' said the landlord, putting the \n","candles on the table. 'nob! take the water to the rooms!' he came in and \n","shut the door. \n","\n","'it's like this,' he began, hesitating and looking troubled. 'if i've \n","done any harm, i'm sorry indeed. but one thing drives out another, as you'll \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","admit; and i'm a busy man. but first one thing and then another this week \n","have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late i hope. you see, \n","i was asked to look out for hobbits of the shire, and for one by the name of \n","baggins in particular.' \n","\n","'and what has that got to do with me?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'ah! you know best,' said the landlord, knowingly. 'i won't give you \n","away; but i was told that this baggins would be going by the name of \n","underhill, and i was given a description that fits you well enough, if i may \n","say so.' \n","\n","'indeed! let's have it then!' said frodo, unwisely interrupting. \n","\n","'a stout little fellow with red cheeks, ' said mr. butterbur solemnly. \n","\n","pippin chuckled, but sam looked indignant. 'that won't help you much; it \n","goes for most hobbits. barley, he says to me,' continued mr. butterbur with \n","a glance at pippin. 'but this one is taller than some and fairer than most, \n","and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. begging your \n","pardon, but he said it, not me.' \n","\n","'he said it? and who was he?' asked frodo eagerly. \n","\n","'ah! that was gandalf, if you know who i mean. a wizard they say he is, \n","but he's a good friend of mine, whether or no. but now i don't know what \n","he'll have to say to me, if i see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into \n","a block of wood, i shouldn't wonder. he's a bit hasty. still what's done \n","can't be undone. ' \n","\n","'well, what have you done?' said frodo, getting impatient with the slow \n","unravelling of butterbur's thoughts. \n","\n","'where was i?' said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers. \n","\n","'ah, yes ! old gandalf. three months back he walked right into my room \n","without a knock. barley, he says, i'm off in the morning. will you do \n","something for me? you've only to name it, i said. i'm in a hurry, said he, \n","and i've no time myself, but i want a message took to the shire. have you \n","anyone you can send, and trust to go? i can find someone, i said, tomorrow, \n","maybe, or the day after. make it tomorrow, he says, and then he gave me a \n","letter. \n","\n","'it's addressed plain enough,' said mr. butterbur, producing a letter \n","from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued \n","his reputation as a lettered man): \n","\n","mr frodo baggins, bag end, hobbiton in the shire. \n","\n","'a letter for me from gandalf!' cried frodo. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'ah!' said mr. butterbur. 'then your right name is baggins?' \n","\n","'it is,' said frodo, 'and you had better give me that letter at once, \n","and explain why you never sent it. that's what you came to tell me, i \n","suppose, though you've taken a long time to come to the point.' \n","\n","poor mr. butterbur looked troubled. 'you're right, master,' he said, \n","\n","'and i beg your pardon. and i'm mortal afraid of what gandalf will say, if \n","harm comes of it. but i didn't keep it back a-purpose. i put it by safe. \n","\n","then i couldn't find nobody willing to go to the shire next day, nor the day \n","after, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after \n","another drove it out of my mind. i'm a busy man. i'll do what i can to set \n","matters right, and if there's any help i can give, you've only to name it. \n","\n","'leaving the letter aside, i promised gandalf no less. barley, he says \n","to me, this friend of mine from the shire, he may be coming out this way \n","before long, him and another. he'll be calling himself underhill. mind that! \n","but you need ask no questions. and if i'm not with him, he may be in \n","trouble, and he may need help. do whatever you can for him, and i'll be \n","grateful, he says. and here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.' \n","\n","'what do you mean?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'these black men,' said the landlord lowering his voice. 'they're \n","looking for baggins, and if they mean well, then i'm a hobbit. it was on \n","monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. uncanny, \n","\n","i \n","\n","called it. nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the door \n","asking for a hobbit called baggins. nob's hair was all stood on end. i bid \n","the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they've been \n","asking the same question all the way to archet, i hear. and that ranger, \n","strider, he's been asking questions, too. tried to get in here to see you, \n","before you'd had bite or sup, he did.' \n","\n","'fie did!' said strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. 'and \n","much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, barliman.' \n","\n","the landlord jumped with surprise. 'you!' he cried. 'you're always \n","popping up. what do you want now?' \n","\n","'he's here with my leave,' said frodo. 'he came to offer me his help.' \n","\n","'well, you know your own business, maybe,' said mr. butterbur, looking \n","suspiciously at strider. 'but if i was in your plight, i wouldn't take up \n","with a ranger.' \n","\n","'then who would you take up with?' asked strider. 'a fat innkeeper who \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day? they \n","cannot stay in the pony for ever, and they cannot go home. they have a long \n","road before them. will you go with them and keep the black men off?' \n","\n","'me? leave bree! i wouldn't do that for any money,' said mr. butterbur, \n","looking really scared. 'but why can't you stay here quiet for a bit, mr. \n","underhill? what are all these queer goings on? what are these black men \n","after, and where do they come from, i'd like to know?' \n","\n","'i'm sorry i can't explain it all,' answered frodo. 'i am tired and \n","very worried, and it's a long tale. but if you mean to help me, i ought to \n","warn you that you will be in danger as long as i am in your house. these \n","black riders: i am not sure, but i think, i fear they come from ' \n","\n","'they come from mordor,' said strider in a low voice. 'from mordor, \n","barliman, if that means anything to you.' \n","\n","'save us!' cried mr. butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was \n","known to him. 'that is the worst news that has come to bree in my time.' 'it \n","is,' said frodo. 'are you still willing to help me?' 'i am,' said mr. \n","\n","butterbur. 'more than ever. though i don't know what the likes of me can do \n","against, against ' he faltered. \n","\n","'against the shadow in the east,' said strider quietly. 'not much, \n","barliman, but every little helps. you can let mr. underhill stay here \n","tonight, as mr. underhill, and you can forget the name of baggins, till he \n","is far away.' \n","\n","'i'll do that,' said butterbur. 'but they'll find out he's here without \n","help from me, i'm afraid. it's a pity mr. baggins drew attention to himself \n","this evening, to say no more. the story of that mr. bilbo's going off has \n","been heard before tonight in bree. even our nob has been doing some guessing \n","in his slow pate: and there are others in bree quicker in the uptake than he \n","is.' \n","\n","'well, we can only hope the riders won't come back yet,' said frodo. \n","\n","'i hope not, indeed,' said butterbur. 'but spooks or no spooks, they \n","won't get in the pony so easy. don't you worry till the morning. nob'll say \n","no word. no black man shall pass my doors, while i can stand on my legs. me \n","and my folk'll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you \n","can.' \n","\n","'in any case we must be called at dawn,' said frodo. 'we must get off \n","as early as possible. breakfast at six-thirty, please.' \n","\n","'right! i'll see to the orders,' said the landlord. 'good night, mr. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","baggins - underhill, i should say! good night - now, bless me! where's your \n","mr. brandybuck?' \n","\n","'i don't know,' said frodo with sudden anxiety. they had forgotten all \n","about merry, and it was getting late. 'i am afraid he is out. he said \n","something about going for a breath of air.' \n","\n","'well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on \n","a holiday!' said butterbur. 'i must go and bar the doors quick, but i'll see \n","your friend is let in when he comes. i'd better send nob to look for him. \n","good night to you all!' at last mr. butterbur went out, with another \n","doubtful look at strider and a shake of his head. his footsteps retreated \n","down the passage. \n","\n","'well?' said strider. 'when are you going to open that letter?' frodo \n","looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. it seemed certainly to be \n","gandalf s. inside, written in the wizard's strong but graceful script, was \n","the following message: \n","\n","the prancing pony, bree. midyear's day, shire year, 1418. \n","\n","dear frodo, \n","\n","bad news has reached me here. i must go off at once. you had better \n","leave bag end soon, and get out of the shire before the end of july at \n","latest. i will return as soon as i can; and i will follow you, if i find \n","that you are gone. leave a message for me here, if you pass through bree. \n","you can trust the landlord (butterbur). you may meet a friend of mine on the \n","road: a man, lean, dark, tall, by some called strider. he knows our business \n","and will help you. make for rivendell. there i hope we may meet again. if i \n","do not come, elrond will advise you. \n","\n","yours in haste \n","\n","gandalf. \n","\n","ps. do not use it again, not far any reason whatever! do not travel by \n","night! \n","\n","pps. make sure that it is the real strider. there are many strange men \n","on the roads. his true name is aragorn. \n","\n","all that is gold does not glitter, \n","\n","not all those who wander are lost; \n","\n","the old that is strong does not wither, \n","\n","deep roots are not reached by the frost. \n","\n","from the ashes a fire shall be woken, \n","\n","a light from the shadows shall spring; \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","renewed shall be blade that was broken, \n","the crownless again shall be king. \n","\n","\n","\n","ppps. i hope butterbur sends this promptly. a worthy man, but his \n","memory is like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. if he forgets, i \n","shall roast him. \n","\n","fare well 7 \n","\n","frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to pippin and sam. \n","'really old butterbur has made a mess of things!' he said. 'he deserves \n","roasting. if i had got this at once, we might all have been safe in \n","rivendell by now. but what can have happened to gandalf? he writes as if he \n","was going into great danger.' \n","\n","'he has been doing that for many years,' said strider. \n","\n","frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about gandalf s \n","second postscript. 'why didn't you tell me that you were gandalf s friend at \n","once?' he asked. 'it would have saved time.' \n","\n","'would it? would any of you have believed me till now?' said strider. \n","\n","'i knew nothing of this letter. for all i knew i had to persuade you to \n","trust me without proofs, if i was to help you. in any case, i did not intend \n","to tell you all about myself at once. i had to study you first, and make \n","sure of you. the enemy has set traps for me before now. as soon as i had \n","made up my mind, i was ready to tell you whatever you asked. but i must \n","admit,' he added with a queer laugh, 'that i hoped you would take to me for \n","my own sake. a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for \n","friendship. but there, i believe my looks are against me.' \n","\n","'they are - at first sight at any rate,' laughed pippin with sudden \n","relief after reading gandalf's letter. 'but handsome is as handsome does, as \n","we say in the shire; and i daresay we shall all look much the same after \n","lying for days in hedges and ditches.' \n","\n","'it would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering \n","in the wild to make you look like strider,' he answered. 'and you would die \n","first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.' \n","\n","pippin subsided; but sam was not daunted, and he still eyed strider \n","dubiously. 'how do we know you are the strider that gandalf speaks about?' \n","he demanded. 'you never mentioned gandalf, till this letter came out. you \n","might be a play-acting spy, for all i can see, trying to get us to go with \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","you. you might have done in the real strider and took his clothes. what have \n","you to say to that?' \n","\n","'that you are a stout fellow,' answered strider; 'but i am afraid my \n","only answer to you, sam gamgee, is this. if i had killed the real strider, i \n","could kill you. and i should have killed you already without so much talk. \n","\n","if i was after the ring, i could have it - now!' \n","\n","he stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. in his eyes gleamed a \n","light, keen and commanding. throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the \n","hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side. they did not dare to \n","move. sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly. \n","\n","'but i am the real strider, fortunately,' he said, looking down at them \n","with his face softened by a sudden smile. 'i am aragorn son of arathorn; and \n","if by life or death i can save you, i will.' \n","\n","there was a long silence. at last frodo spoke with hesitation. 'i \n","believed that you were a friend before the letter came,' he said, 'or at \n","least i wished to. you have frightened me several times tonight, but never \n","in the way that servants of the enemy would, or so i imagine. i think one of \n","his spies would - well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.' \n","\n","'i see,' laughed strider. 'i look foul and feel fair. is that it? all \n","that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost ' \n","\n","'did the verses apply to you then?' asked frodo. 'i could not make out \n","what they were about. but how did you know that they were in gandalf s \n","letter, if you have never seen it?' \n","\n","'i did not know,' he answered. 'but i am aragorn, and those verses go \n","with that name.' he drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was \n","indeed broken a foot below the hilt. 'not much use is it, sam?' said \n","strider. 'but the time is near when it shall be forged anew.' \n","\n","sam said nothing. \n","\n","'well,' said strider, 'with sam's permission we will call that settled. \n","\n","strider shall be your guide. we shall have a rough road tomorrow. even if we \n","are allowed to leave bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it \n","unnoticed. but i shall try to get lost as soon as possible. i know one or \n","two ways out of bree-land other than the main road. if once we shake off the \n","pursuit, i shall make for weathertop.' \n","\n","'weathertop?' said sam. 'what's that?' \n","\n","'it is a hill, just to the north of the road, about half way from here \n","to rivendell. it commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chance to look about us. gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. \n","after weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have \n","to choose between various dangers.' \n","\n","'when did you last see gandalf?' asked frodo. 'do you know where he is, \n","or what he is doing?' \n","\n","strider looked grave. 'i do not know,' he said. 'i came west with him \n","in the spring. i have often kept watch on the borders of the shire in the \n","last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. he seldom left it unguarded. we \n","last met on the first of may: at sam ford down the brandywine. he told me \n","that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for \n","rivendell in the last week of september. as i knew he was at your side, i \n","went away on a journey of my own. and that has proved ill; for plainly some \n","news reached him, and i was not at hand to help. \n","\n","'i am troubled, for the first time since i have known him. we should \n","have had messages, even if he could not come himself. when i returned, many \n","days ago, i heard the ill news. the tidings had gone far and wide that \n","gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. it was the elven-folk of \n","gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your \n","home; but there was no news of your leaving buckland. i have been watching \n","the east road anxiously.' \n","\n","'do you think the black riders have anything to do with it - with \n","gandalf's absence, i mean?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'i do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except \n","the enemy himself,' said strider. 'but do not give up hope ! gandalf is \n","greater than you shire-folk know - as a rule you can only see his jokes and \n","toys. but this business of ours will be his greatest task.' \n","\n","pippin yawned. 'i am sorry,' he said, 'but i am dead tired. in spite of \n","all the danger and worry i must go to bed, or sleep where i sit. where is \n","that silly fellow, merry? it would be the last straw, if we had to go out in \n","the dark to look for him.' \n","\n","at that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the \n","passage. merry came in with a rush followed by nob. he shut the door \n","hastily, and leaned against it. he was out of breath. they stared at him in \n","alarm for a moment before he gasped: 'i have seen them, frodo! i have seen \n","them! black riders!' \n","\n","'black riders!' cried frodo. 'where?' \n","\n","'here. in the village. i stayed indoors for an hour. then as you did \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","not come back, i went out for a stroll. i had come back again and was \n","standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. suddenly i \n","shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son \n","of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of \n","the lamplight. it slid away at once into the dark without a sound. there was \n","no horse.' \n","\n","'which way did it go?' asked strider, suddenly and sharply. merry \n","started, noticing the stranger for the first time. 'go on!' said frodo. \n","\n","'this is a friend of gandalf's. i will explain later.' \n","\n","'it seemed to make off up the road, eastward,' continued merry. 'i \n","tried to follow. of course, it vanished almost at once; but i went round the \n","corner and on as far as the last house on the road.' \n","\n","strider looked at merry with wonder. 'you have a stout heart,' he said; \n","\n","'but it was foolish.' \n","\n","'i don't know,' said merry. 'neither brave nor silly, i think. i could \n","hardly help myself. i seemed to be drawn somehow. anyway, i went, and \n","suddenly i heard voices by the hedge. one was muttering; and the other was \n","whispering, or hissing. i couldn't hear a word that was said. i did not \n","creep any closer, because i began to tremble all over. then i felt \n","terrified, and i turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when \n","something came behind me and i... i fell over.' \n","\n","'i found him, sir,' put in nob. 'mr. butterbur sent me out with a \n","lantern. i went down to west-gate, and then back up towards south-gate. just \n","nigh bill ferny's house i thought i could see something in the road. i \n","couldn't swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over \n","something, lilting it. i gave a shout, but where i got up to the spot there \n","was no signs of them, and only mr. brandybuck lying by the roadside. he \n","seemed to be asleep. \"i thought i had fallen into deep water,\" he says to \n","me, when i shook him. very queer he was, and as soon as i had roused him, he \n","got up and ran back here like a hare.' \n","\n","'i am afraid that's true,' said merry, 'though i don't know what i \n","said. i had an ugly dream, which i can't remember. i went to pieces. i don't \n","know what came over me.' \n","\n","'i do,' said strider. 'the black breath. the riders must have left \n","their horses outside, and passed back through the south-gate in secret. they \n","will know all the news now, for they have visited bill ferny; and probably \n","that southerner was a spy as well. something may happen in the night, before \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","we leave bree.' \n","\n","'what will happen?' said merry. 'will they attack the inn?' 'no, i \n","think not,' said strider. 'they are not all here yet. and in any case that \n","is not their way. in dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not \n","openly attack a house where there are lights and many people -not until they \n","are desperate, not while all the long leagues of eriador still lie before \n","us. but their power is in terror, and already some in bree are in their \n","clutch. they will drive these wretches to some evil work: ferny, and some of \n","the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. they had words with harry at \n","west-gate on monday. i was watching them. he was white and shaking when \n","they \n","\n","left him.' \n","\n","'we seem to have enemies all round,' said frodo. 'what are we to do?' \n","\n","'stay here, and do not go to your rooms ! they are sure to have found \n","out which those are. the hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close \n","to the ground. we will all remain together and bar this window and the door. \n","but first nob and i will fetch your luggage.' \n","\n","while strider was gone, frodo gave merry a rapid account of all that \n","had happened since supper. merry was still reading and pondering gandalf's \n","letter when strider and nob returned. \n","\n","'well masters,' said nob, 'i've ruffled up the clothes and put in a \n","bolster down the middle of each bed. and i made a nice imitation of your \n","head with a brown woollen mat, mr. bag - underhill, sir,' he added with a \n","grin. \n","\n","pippin laughed. 'very life-like!' he said. 'but what will happen when \n","they have penetrated the disguise?' \n","\n","'we shall see,' said strider. 'fet us hope to hold the fort till \n","morning.' \n","\n","'good night to you,' said nob, and went off to take his part in the \n","watch on the doors. \n","\n","their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. they pushed a low \n","chair against the door and shut the window. peering out, frodo saw that the \n","night was still clear. the sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of \n","bree-hill. he then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the \n","curtains together. strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles. \n","\n","the hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the \n","hearth; but strider settled himself in the chair against the door. they \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","talked for a little, for merry still had several questions to ask. \n","\n","'jumped over the moon!' chuckled merry as he rolled himself in his \n","blanket. 'very ridiculous of you, frodo! but i wish i had been there to see. \n","the worthies of bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence.' \n","\n","'i hope so,' said strider. then they all fell silent, and one by one \n","the hobbits dropped off to sleep. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 11. a knife in the dark \n","\n","\n","\n","as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree, darkness lay on \n","buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river -bank. the house at \n","crickhollow stood silent. fatty bolger opened the door cautiously and peered \n","out. a feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to \n","rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air. \n","\n","as he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the \n","gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound. \n","terror seized him. he shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in \n","the hall. then he shut and locked the door. \n","\n","the night deepened. there came the soft sound of horses led with \n","stealth along the lane. outside the gate they stopped, and three black \n","figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. one went \n","to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they \n","stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. the \n","house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly. \n","\n","there was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. the \n","cold hour before dawn was passing. the figure by the door moved. in the dark \n","without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been \n","unsheathed. there was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered. \n","\n","'open, in the name of mordor!' said a voice thin and menacing. \n","\n","at a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and \n","lock broken. the black figures passed swiftly in. \n","\n","at that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. it rent the \n","night like fire on a hill -top. \n","\n","awake! fear! fire! foes! awake! \n","\n","fatty bolger had not been idle. as soon as he saw the dark shapes creep \n","from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish. and run he did, \n","out of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields. when he \n","reached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the \n","doorstep. 'no, no, no!' he was crying. 'no, not me! i haven't got it!' it \n","was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about. \n","at \n","\n","last they got the idea that enemies were in buckland, some strange invasion \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","from the old forest. and then they lost no more time. \n","\n","fear! fire! foes! \n","\n","the brandybucks were blowing the horn-call of buckland, that had not \n","been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolves came in the \n","fell winter, when the brandywine was frozen over. \n","\n","awake! awake! \n","\n","far-away answering horns were heard. the alarm was spreading. the black \n","figures fled from the house. one of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the \n","step, as he ran. in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out, and gathering to \n","a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. all about crickhollow there \n","was the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. but the \n","black riders rode like a gale to the north-gate. let the little people blow! \n","sauron would deal with them later. meanwhile they had another errand: they \n","knew now that the house was empty and the ring had gone. they rode down \n","the \n","\n","guards at the gate and vanished from the shire. \n","\n","in the early night frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some \n","sound or presence had disturbed him. he saw that strider was sitting alert \n","in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been \n","tended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement. \n","\n","frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with \n","the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. the wind seemed to be curling \n","round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. \n","\n","he opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard. \n","strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang. \n","\n","the first grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming \n","through the open window. \n","\n","as soon as strider had roused them all, he led the way to their \n","bedrooms. when they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice: \n","the windows had been forced open and were swinging, and the curtains were \n","flapping; the beds were tossed about, and the bolsters slashed and flung \n","upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces. \n","\n","strider immediately went to fetch the landlord. poor mr. butterbur \n","looked sleepy and frightened. he had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he \n","said), but he had never heard a sound. \n","\n","'never has such a thing happened in my time!' he cried, raising his \n","hands in horror. 'guests unable to sleep in their beds, and good bolsters \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","ruined and all! what are we coming to?' \n","\n","'dark times,' said strider. 'but for the present you may be left in \n","peace, when you have got rid of us. we will leave at once. never mind about \n","breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do. we shall be packed \n","in a few minutes.' \n","\n","mr. butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and \n","to fetch them a 'bite'. but very soon he came back in dismay. the ponies had \n","vanished! the stable-doors had all been opened in the night, and they were \n","gone: not only merry's ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place. \n","\n","frodo was crushed by the news. how could they hope to reach rivendell \n","on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? they might as well set out for the \n","moon. strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was \n","weighing up their strength and courage. \n","\n","'ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,' he said at last, \n","thoughtfully, as if he guessed what frodo had in mind. 'we should not go \n","much slower on foot, not on the roads that i mean to take. i was going to \n","walk in any case. it is the food and stores that trouble me. we cannot count \n","on getting anything to eat between here and rivendell, except what we take \n","with us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or \n","forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way. how much are you \n","prepared to carry on your backs?' \n","\n","'as much as we must,' said pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to \n","show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt). \n","\n","'i can carry enough for two,' said sam defiantly. \n","\n","'can't anything be done, mr. butterbur?' asked frodo. 'can't we get a \n","couple of ponies in the village, or even one just for the baggage? i don't \n","suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy them,' he added, \n","doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it. \n","\n","'i doubt it,' said the landlord unhappily. 'the two or three \n","riding-ponies that there were in bree were stabled in my yard, and they're \n","gone. as for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there \n","are very few of them in bree, and they won't be for sale. but i'll do what i \n","can. i'll rout out bob and send him round as soon as may be.' \n","\n","'yes,' said strider reluctantly, 'you had better do that. i am afraid \n","we shall have to try to get one pony at least. but so ends all hope of \n","starting early, and slipping away quietly! we might as well have blown a \n","horn to announce our departure. that was part of their plan, no doubt.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'there is one crumb of comfort,' said merry, 'and more than a crumb, i \n","hope: we can have breakfast while we wait - and sit down to it. let's get \n","hold of nob!' \n","\n","in the end there was more than three hours' delay. bob came back with \n","the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the \n","neighbourhood - except one: bill ferny had one that he might possibly sell. \n","\n","'a poor old half-starved creature it is,' said bob; 'but he won't part with \n","it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you're placed, not if i knows \n","bill ferny.' \n","\n","'bill ferny?' said frodo. 'isn't there some trick? wouldn't the beast \n","bolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?' \n","\n","'i wonder,' said strider. 'but i cannot imagine any animal running home \n","to him, once it got away. i fancy this is only an afterthought of kind \n","master ferny's: just a way of increasing his profits from the affair. the \n","chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death's door. but there \n","does not seem any choice. what does he want for it?' \n","\n","bill ferny's price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at \n","least three times the pony's value in those pans. it proved to be a bony, \n","underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet. \n","\n","mr. butterbur paid for it himself, and offered merry another eighteen pence \n","as some compensation for the lost animals. he was an honest man, and \n","well-off as things were reckoned in bree; but thirty silver pennies was a \n","sore blow to him, and being cheated by bill ferny made it harder to bear. \n","\n","asa matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. it turned \n","out later that only one horse had been actually stolen. the others had been \n","driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different \n","corners of the bree-land. merry's ponies had escaped altogether, and \n","eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the downs in \n","search of fatty lumpkin. so they came under the care of tom bombadil for a \n","while, and were well-off. but when news of the events at bree came to tom's \n","ears, he sent them to mr. butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very \n","fair price. they had to work harder in bree, but bob treated them well; so \n","on the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey. but \n","they never came to rivendell. \n","\n","however, in the meanwhile for all mr. butterbur knew his money was gone \n","for good, or for bad. and he had other troubles. for there was a great \n","commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","raid on the inn. the southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed \n","the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had \n","also disappeared in the night, none other than bill ferny's squint-eyed \n","companion. suspicion fell on him at once. \n","\n","'if you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,' said \n","butterbur angrily, 'you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not \n","come shouting at me. go and ask ferny where your handsome friend is!' but it \n","appeared that he was nobody's friend, and nobody could recollect when he had \n","joined their party. \n","\n","after their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together \n","further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting. it was \n","close on ten o'clock before they at last got off. by that time the whole of \n","bree was buzzing with excitement. frodo's vanishing trick; the appearance of \n","the black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that \n","strider the ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as \n","would last for many uneventful years. most of the inhabitants of bree and \n","staddle, and many even from combe and archet, were crowded in the road \n","to \n","\n","see the travellers start. the other guests in the inn were at the doors or \n","hanging out of the windows. \n","\n","strider had changed his mind, and he decided to leave bree by the main \n","road. any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters \n","worse: half the inhabitants would follow them, to see what they were up to, \n","and to prevent them from trespassing. \n","\n","they said farewell to nob and bob, and took leave of mr. butterbur with \n","many thanks. 'i hope we shall meet again some day, when things are merry \n","once more,' said frodo. 'i should like nothing better than to stay in your \n","house in peace for a while.' \n","\n","they tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd. \n","not all the faces were friendly, nor all the words that were shouted. but \n","strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the bree-landers, and those that \n","he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. he walked in front with frodo; \n","next came merry and pippin; and last came sam leading the pony, which was \n","laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but \n","already it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its \n","fortunes. sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. he had a pocket full of \n","them: a parting present from nob and bob. 'apples for walking, and a pipe \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","for sitting,' he said. 'but i reckon i'll miss them both before long.' \n","\n","the hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of \n","doors, or popped over walls and fences, as they passed. but as they drew \n","near to the further gate, frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick \n","hedge: the last house in the village. in one of the windows he caught a \n","glimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once. \n","\n","'so that's where that southerner is hiding!' he thought. 'he looks more \n","than half like a goblin.' \n","\n","over the hedge another man was staring boldly. he had heavy black \n","brows, and dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer. he was \n","smoking a short black pipe. as they approached he took it out of his mouth \n","and spat. \n","\n","'morning, longshanks!' he said. 'off early? found some friends at \n","last?' strider nodded, but did not answer. 'morning, my little friends!' he \n","said to the others. 'i suppose you know who you've taken up with? that's \n","stick -at-naught strider, that is! though i've heard other names not so \n","pretty. watch out tonight! and you, sammie, don't go ill-treating my poor \n","old pony! pah!' he spat again. \n","\n","sam turned quickly. 'and you. ferny,' he said, 'put your ugly face out \n","of sight, or it will get hurt.' with a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an \n","apple left his hand and hit bill square on the nose. he ducked too late, and \n","curses came from behind the hedge. 'waste of a good apple,' said sam \n","regretfully, and strode on. \n","\n","at last they left the village behind. the escort of children and \n","stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the \n","south-gate. passing through, they kept on along the road for some miles. it \n","bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet \n","of bree-hill, and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded \n","country. to their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit -holes of \n","staddle on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in a deep \n","hollow away north of the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed \n","where combe lay; \n","\n","archet was hidden in the trees beyond. \n","\n","after the road had run down some way, and had left bree-hill standing \n","tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards the \n","north. 'this is where we leave the open and take to cover,' said strider. \n","\n","'not a \"short cut\", i hope,' said pippin. 'our last short cut through \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","woods nearly ended in disaster.' \n","\n","'ah, but you had not got me with you then,' laughed strider. 'my cuts, \n","short or long, don't go wrong.' he took a look up and down the road. no one \n","was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley. \n","\n","his plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the \n","country, was to go towards archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on \n","the east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to \n","weathertop hill. in that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great \n","loop of the road, which further on bent southwards to avoid the midgewater \n","marshes. but, of course, they would have to pass through the marshes \n","themselves, and strider's description of them was not encouraging. \n","\n","however, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. indeed, if it \n","had not been for the disturbing events of the night before, they would have \n","enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time. the sun was \n","shining, clear but not too hot. the woods in the valley were still leafy and \n","full of colour, and seemed peaceful and wholesome. strider guided them \n","confidently among the many crossing paths, although left to themselves they \n","would soon have been at a loss. he was taking a wandering course with many \n","turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit. \n","\n","'bill ferny will have watched where we left the road, for certain,' he \n","said; 'though i don't think he will follow us himself. he knows the land \n","round here well enough, but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood. it \n","is what he may tell others that i am afraid of. i don't suppose they are far \n","away. if they think we have made for archet, so much the better.' \n","\n","whether because of strider's skill or for some other reason, they saw \n","no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day: neither \n","two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox and a few \n","squirrels. the next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards; and \n","still all was quiet and peaceful. on the third day out from bree they came \n","out of the chetwood. the land had been falling steadily, ever since they \n","turned aside from the road, and they now entered a wide flat expanse of \n","country, much more difficult to manage. they were far beyond the borders of \n","the bree-land, out in the pathless wilderness, and drawing near to the \n","midge- water marshes. \n","\n","the ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they \n","came upon pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the \n","warbling of little hidden birds. they had to pick their way carefully to \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","keep both dry-footed and on their proper course. at first they made \n","fan-progress, but as they went on, their passage became slower and more \n","dangerous. the marshes were bewildering and treacherous, and there was no \n","permanent trail even for rangers to find through their shifting quagmires. \n","\n","the flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds of tiny \n","midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair. \n","\n","'i am being eaten alive!' cried pippin. 'midgewater! there are more \n","midges than water!' \n","\n","'what do they live on when they can't get hobbit?' asked sam, \n","scratching his neck. \n","\n","they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. their \n","camping-place was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the biting insects \n","would not let them sleep. there were also abominable creatures haunting the \n","reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the \n","cricket. there were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round, \n","neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were \n","nearly frantic. \n","\n","the next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as \n","comfortless. though the neekerbreekers (as sam called them) had been left \n","behind, the midges still pursued them. \n","\n","as frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that \n","far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many \n","times. it was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off. \n","\n","'what is the light?' he said to strider, who had risen, and was \n","standing, gazing ahead into the night. \n","\n","'i do not know,' strider answered. 'it is too distant to make out. it \n","is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.' \n","\n","frodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white \n","flashes, and against them the tall dark figure of strider, standing silent \n","and watchful. at last he passed into uneasy sleep. \n","\n","they had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last \n","straggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind them. the land before \n","them began steadily to rise again. away in the distance eastward they could \n","now see a line of hills. the highest of them was at the right of the line \n","and a little separated from the others. it had a conical top, slightly \n","flattened at the summit. \n","\n","'that is weathertop,' said strider. 'the old road, which we have left \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","far away on our right, runs to the south of it and passes not far from its \n","foot. we might reach it by noon tomorrow, if we go straight towards it. i \n","suppose we had better do so.' \n","\n","'what do you mean?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'i mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. it \n","is close to the road.' \n","\n","'but surely we were hoping to find gandalf there?' \n","\n","'yes; but the hope is faint. if he comes this way at all, he may not \n","pass through bree, and so he may not know what we are doing. and anyway, \n","unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; it will \n","not be safe for him or for us to wait there long. if the riders fail to find \n","us in the wilderness, they are likely to make for weathertop themselves. it \n","commands a wide view all round. indeed, there are many birds and beasts in \n","this country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. not \n","all the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than \n","they are.' \n","\n","the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. sam looked up into \n","the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright \n","unfriendly eyes. 'you do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome, strider!' \n","he said. \n","\n","'what do you advise us to do?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'i think,' answered strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, 'i \n","think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can, to \n","make for the line of hills, not for weathertop. there we can strike a path i \n","know that runs at their feet; it will bring us to weathertop from the north \n","and less openly. then we shall see what we shall see.' \n","\n","all that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening came \n","down. the land became drier and more barren; but mists and vapours lay \n","behind them on the marshes. a few melancholy birds were piping and wailing, \n","until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty \n","silence fell. the hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing \n","through the cheerful windows of bag end far away. \n","\n","at the day's end they came to a stream that wandered down from the \n","hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland, and they went up along its \n","banks while the light lasted. it was already night when at last they halted \n","and made their camp under some stunted alder -trees by the shores of the \n","stream. ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","backs of the hills. that night they set a watch, and strider, it seemed, did \n","not sleep at all. the moon was waxing, and in the early night -hours a cold \n","grey light lay on the land. \n","\n","next morning they set out again soon after sunrise. there was a frost \n","in the air, and the sky was a pale clear blue. the hobbits felt refreshed, \n","as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. already they were getting used \n","to much walking on short commons - shorter at any rate than what in the \n","shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs. \n","pippin declared that frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been. \n","\n","'very odd,' said frodo, tightening his belt, 'considering that there is \n","actually a good deal less of me. i hope the thinning process will not go on \n","indefinitely, or i shall become a wraith.' \n","\n","'do not speak of such things!' said strider quickly, and with \n","surprising earnestness. \n","\n","the hills drew nearer. they made an undulating ridge, often rising \n","almost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or \n","passes leading into the eastern land beyond. along the crest of the ridge \n","the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and \n","dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone. \n","\n","by night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes, and there they \n","camped. it was the night of the fifth of october, and they were six days out \n","from bree. \n","\n","in the morning they found, for the first time since they had left the \n","chetwood, a track plain to see. they turned right and followed it \n","southwards. it ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep \n","as much hidden as possible from the view, both of the hill-tops above and of \n","the flats to the west. it dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and \n","where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there \n","were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers \n","almost like a hedge. \n","\n","'i wonder who made this path, and what for,' said merry, as they walked \n","along one of these avenues, where the stones were unusually large and \n","closely set. 'i am not sure that i like it: it has a - well, rather a \n","barrow- wightish look. is there any barrow on weathertop?' \n","\n","'no. there is no barrow on weathertop, nor on any of these hills,' \n","answered strider. 'the men of the west did not live here; though in their \n","latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","out of angmar. this path was made to serve the forts along the walls. but \n","long before, in the first days of the north kingdom, they built a great \n","watch-tower on weathertop, amon syl they called it. it was burned and \n","broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown \n","on the old hill's head. yet once it was tall and fair. it is told that \n","elendil stood there watching for the coming of gil-galad out of the west, in \n","the days of the last alliance.' \n","\n","the hobbits gazed at strider. it seemed that he was learned in old \n","lore, as well as in the ways of the wild. 'who was gil-galad?' asked merry; \n","but strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. suddenly a low \n","voice murmured: \n","\n","gil-galad was an elven-king. \n","\n","of him the harpers sadly sing: \n","\n","the last whose realm was fair and free \n","\n","between the mountains and the sea. \n","\n","his sword was long, his lance was keen, \n","his shining helm afar was seen; \n","the countless stars of heaven's field \n","were mirrored in his silver shield. \n","\n","but long ago he rode away, \n","and where he dwelleth none can say; \n","for into darkness fell his star \n","in mordor where the shadows are. \n","\n","the others turned in amazement, for the voice was sam's. \n","\n","'don't stop!' said merry. \n","\n","'that's all i know,' stammered sam, blushing. 'i learned it from mr. \n","\n","bilbo when i was a lad. he used to tell me tales like that, knowing how i \n","was always one for hearing about elves. it was mr. bilbo as taught me my \n","letters. he was mighty book -learned was dear old mr. bilbo. and he wrote \n","poetry. he wrote what i have just said.' \n","\n","'he did not make it up,' said strider. 'it is pan of the lay that is \n","called the fall of gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. bilbo must have \n","translated it. i never knew that.' \n","\n","'there was a lot more,' said sam, 'all about mordor. i didn't learn \n","that part, it gave me the shivers i never thought i should be going that way \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","myself!' \n","\n","'going to mordor!' cried pippin. 'i hope it won't come to that!' \n","\n","'do not speak that name so loudly!' said strider. \n","\n","it was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the \n","path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the october sun, a \n","grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the \n","hill they decided to make for the top at once, while the daylight was broad \n","concealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy \n","or spy was observing them. nothing was to be seen moving on the hill. if \n","gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him. \n","\n","on the western flank of weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at \n","the bottom of which there was a bowl -shaped dell with grassy sides. there \n","they left sam and pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage. the \n","other three went on. after half an hour's plodding climb strider reached the \n","crown of the hill; frodo and merry followed, tired and breathless. the last \n","slope had been steep and rocky. \n","\n","on the top they found, as strider had said, a wide ring of ancient \n","stonework, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass. but in the centre a \n","cairn of broken stones had been piled. they were blackened as if with fire. \n","about them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the \n","grass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hill-top; but \n","there was no sign of any living thing. \n","\n","standing upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round below \n","them a wide prospect, for the most pan of lands empty and featureless, \n","except for patches of woodland away to the south, beyond which they caught \n","here and there the glint of distant water. beneath them on this southern \n","side there ran like a ribbon the old road, coming out of the west and \n","winding up and down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east. \n","nothing was moving on it. following its line eastward with their eyes they \n","saw the mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; \n","\n","behind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind those again were \n","high white peaks glimmering among the clouds. \n","\n","'well, here we are!' said merry. 'and very cheerless and uninviting it \n","looks! there is no water and no shelter. and no sign of gandalf. but i don't \n","blame him for not waiting - if he ever came here.' \n","\n","'i wonder,' said strider, looking round thoughtfully. 'even if he was a \n","day or two behind us at bree, he could have arrived here first. he can ride \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","very swiftly when need presses.' suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone \n","on the top of the cairn; it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as if \n","it had escaped the fire. he picked it up and examined it, turning it in his \n","fingers. \"this has been handled recently,' he said. 'what do you think of \n","these marks?' \n","\n","on the flat under-side frodo saw some scratches: 'there seems to he a \n","stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,' he said. \n","\n","'the stroke on the left might be a g-rune with thin branches,' said \n","strider. 'it might be a sign left by gandalf, though one cannot be sure. the \n","scratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh. but the marks might mean \n","something quite different, and have nothing to do with us. rangers use \n","runes, and they come here sometimes.' \n","\n","'what could they mean, even if gandalf made them?' asked merry \n","\n","'i should say,' answered strider, 'that they stood for g3, and were a \n","sign that gandalf was here on october the third: that is three days ago now. \n","\n","it would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he \n","had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. if that is \n","so, we must be wary.' \n","\n","'i wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may \n","mean,' said frodo 'it would be a great comfort to know that he was on the \n","way, in front of us or behind us.' \n","\n","'perhaps,' said strider. 'for myself, i believe that he was here, and \n","was in danger. there have been scorching flames here; and now the light that \n","we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind. i guess \n","that he was attacked on this hill-top, but with what result i cannot tell. \n","\n","he is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own \n","way to rivendell, as best we can ' \n","\n","'how far is rivendell?' asked merry, gazing round wearily. the world \n","looked wild and wide from weathertop. \n","\n","'i don't know if the road has ever been measured in miles beyond the \n","forsaken inn, a day's journey east of bree,' answered strider. 'some say it \n","is so far, and some say otherwise. it is a strange road, and folk are glad \n","to reach their journey's end, whether the time is long or short. but i know \n","how long it would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill \n","fortune twelve days from here to the ford of bruinen, where the road crosses \n","the loudwater that runs out of rivendell. we have at least a fortnight's \n","journey before us, for i do not think we shall be able to use the road.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'a fortnight!' said frodo. 'a lot may happen in that time.' \n","\n","'it may,' said strider. \n","\n","they stood for a while silent on the hill -top, near its southward edge. \n","\n","in that lonely place frodo for the first time fully realized his \n","homelessness and danger. he wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in \n","the quiet and beloved shire. he stared down at the hateful road, leading \n","back westward - to his home. suddenly he was aware that two black specks \n","were moving slowly along it, going westward; and looking again he saw that \n","three others were creeping eastward to meet them. he gave a cry and clutched \n","strider's arm. \n","\n","'look,' he said, pointing downwards. \n","\n","at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, \n","pulling frodo down beside him. merry threw himself alongside. \n","\n","'what is it?' he whispered. \n","\n","'i do not know, but i fear the worst,' answered strider. \n","\n","slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and peered \n","through a cleft between two jagged stones. the light was no longer bright, \n","for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the east had now \n","overtaken the sun, as it began to go down. they could all see the black \n","specks, but neither frodo nor merry could make out their shapes for certain; \n","yet something told them that there, far below, were black riders assembling \n","on the road beyond the foot of the hill. \n","\n","'yes,' said strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. 'the \n","enemy is here!' \n","\n","hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to \n","find their companions. \n","\n","sam and peregrin had not been idle. they had explored the small dell \n","and the surrounding slopes. not far away they found a spring of clear water \n","in the hillside, and near it footprints not more than a day or two old. in \n","the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a \n","hasty camp. there were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to \n","the hill. behind them sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly \n","stacked. \n","\n","'i wonder if old gandalf has been here,' he said to pippin. 'whoever it \n","was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.' \n","\n","strider was greatly interested in these discoveries. 'i wish i had \n","waited and explored the ground down here myself,' he said, hurrying off to \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the spring to examine the footprints. \n","\n","'it is just as i feared,' he said, when he came back. 'sam and pippin \n","have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. rangers \n","have been here lately. it is they who left the firewood behind. but there \n","are also several newer tracks that were not made by rangers. at least one \n","set was made, only a day or two ago, by heavy boots. at least one. i cannot \n","now be certain, but i think there were many booted feet.' he paused and \n","stood in anxious thought. \n","\n","each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted \n","riders. if the horsemen had already found the dell, the sooner strider led \n","them somewhere else the better. sam viewed the hollow with great dislike, \n","now that he had heard news of their enemies on the road, only a few miles \n","away. \n","\n","'hadn't we better clear out quick, mr. strider?' he asked impatiently. \n","\n","'it is getting late, and i don't like this hole: it makes my heart sink \n","somehow.' \n","\n","'yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,' answered strider, \n","looking up and considering the time and the weather. 'well, sam,' he said at \n","last, 'i do not like this place either; but i cannot think of anywhere \n","better that we could reach before nightfall. at least we are out of sight \n","for the moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen \n","spies. all we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on \n","this side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is \n","here. the road is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried to \n","take cover in the thickets away to the south. on the north side of the road \n","beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles.' \n","\n","'can the riders see ?' asked merry. 'i mean, they seem usually to have \n","used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the \n","right word, at least in the daylight. but you made us lie down flat when you \n","saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.' \n","\n","'i was too careless on the hill-top,' answered strider. 'i was very \n","anxious to find some sign of gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us \n","to go up and stand there so long. for the black horses can see, and the \n","riders can use men and other creatures as spies, as we found at bree. they \n","themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast \n","shadows in their minds, which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark \n","they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us: then they are \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","most to be feared. and at all times they smell the blood of living things, \n","desiring and hating it. senses, too, there are other than sight or smell. we \n","can feel their presence - it troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, \n","and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. also,' he added, and his \n","voice sank to a whisper, 'the ring draws them.' \n","\n","'is there no escape then?' said frodo, looking round wildly. 'if i move \n","i shall be seen and hunted! if i stay, i shall draw them to me!' \n","\n","strider laid his hand on his shoulder. 'there is still hope,' he said. \n","\n","'you are not alone. let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as \n","a sign. there is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall serve for \n","both. sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these \n","riders do not love it, and fear those who wield it. fire is our friend in \n","the wilderness.' \n","\n","'maybe,' muttered sam. 'it is also as good a way of saying \"here we \n","are\" as i can think of, bar shouting.' \n","\n","down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a \n","fire, and prepared a meal. the shades of evening began to fall, and it grew \n","cold. they were suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had not eaten \n","anything since breakfast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper. \n","the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly places \n","deserted by all the races of the world. rangers passed at times beyond the \n","hills, but they were few and did not stay. other wanderers were rare, and of \n","evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of \n","the misty mountains. only on the road would travellers be found, most often \n","dwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help and few \n","words to spare for strangers. \n","\n","'i don't see how our food can be made to last,' said frodo. 'we have \n","been careful enough in the last few days, and this supper is no feast; but \n","we have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks still to go, and \n","perhaps more.' \n","\n","'there is food in the wild,' said strider; 'berry, root, and herb; and \n","i have some skill as a hunter at need. you need not be afraid of starving \n","before winter comes. but gathering and catching food is long and weary work, \n","and we need haste. so tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables \n","of elrond's house!' \n","\n","the cold increased as darkness came on. peering out from the edge of \n","the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","shadow. the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling \n","stars. frodo and his companions huddled round the fire, wrapped in every \n","garment and blanket they possessed; but strider was content with a single \n","cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe. \n","\n","as night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he \n","began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear. he knew many \n","histories and legends of long ago, of elves and men and the good and evil \n","deeds of the elder days. they wondered how old he was, and where he had \n","learned all this lore. \n","\n","tell us of gil-galad,' said merry suddenly, when he paused at the end \n","of a story of the elf-kingdoms. 'do you know any more of that old lay that \n","you spoke of?' \n","\n","'i do indeed,' answered strider. 'so also does frodo, for it concerns \n","us closely.' merry and pippin looked at frodo, who was staring into the \n","fire. \n","\n","'i know only the little that gandalf has told me,' said frodo slowly. \n","'gil-galad was the last of the great elf-kings of middle-earth. gil-galad is \n","starlight in their tongue. with elendil, the elf-friend, he went to the land \n","of ' \n","\n","'no!' said strider interrupting, 'i do not think that tale should be \n","told now with the servants of the enemy at hand. if we win through to the \n","house of elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.' \n","\n","'then tell us some other tale of the old days,' begged sam; 'a tale \n","about the elves before the fading time. i would dearly like to hear more \n","about elves; the dark seems to press round so close.' \n","\n","'i will tell you the tale of tinviel,' said strider, 'in brief - for \n","it is a long tale of which the end is not known; and there are none now, \n","except elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old. it is a fair \n","tale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of middle-earth, and yet it may \n","lift up your hearts.' he was silent for some time, and then he began not to \n","speak but to chant softly: \n","\n","the leaves were long, the grass was green, \n","\n","the hemlock-umbels tall and fair, \n","\n","and in the glade a light was seen \n","\n","of stars in shadow shimmering. \n","\n","tinviel was dancing there \n","\n","to music of a pipe unseen, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and light of stars was in her hair, \n","\n","and in her raiment glimmering. \n","\n","there beren came from mountains cold, \n","and lost he wandered under leaves, \n","\n","and where the elven-river rolled \n","he walked alone and sorrowing. \n","\n","he peered between the hemlock-leaves \n","and saw in wander flowers of gold \n","upon her mantle and her sleeves, \n","\n","and her hair like shadow following. \n","\n","enchantment healed his weary feet \n","that over hills were doomed to roam; \n","\n","and forth he hastened, strong and fleet, \n","and grasped at moonbeams glistening. \n","through woven woods in elvenhome \n","she tightly fled on dancing feet, \n","\n","and left him lonely still to roam \n","in the silent forest listening. \n","\n","he heard there oft the flying sound \n","of feet as light as linden-leaves, \n","\n","or music welling underground, \n","\n","in hidden hollows quavering. \n","\n","now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, \n","and one by one with sighing sound \n","whispering fell the beechen leaves \n","in the wintry woodland wavering. \n","\n","he sought her ever, wandering far \n","where leaves of years were thickly strewn, \n","by light of moon and ray of star \n","in frosty heavens shivering. \n","\n","her mantle glinted in the moon, \n","\n","as on a hill-top high and far \n","\n","she danced, and at her feet was strewn \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","a mist of silver quivering. \n","\n","\n","\n","when winter passed, she came again, \n","and her song released the sudden spring, \n","like rising lark, and falling rain, \n","\n","and melting water bubbling. \n","\n","he saw the elven-flowers spring \n","about her feet, and healed again \n","he longed by her to dance and sing \n","upon the grass untroubling. \n","\n","again she fled, but swift he came. \n","tinviel! tinviel! \n","\n","he called her by her elvish name; \n","\n","and there she halted listening. \n","\n","one moment stood she, and a spell \n","his voice laid on her: beren came, \n","\n","and doom fell on tinviel \n","that in his arms lay glistening. \n","\n","as beren looked into her eyes \n","within the shadows of her hair, \n","\n","the trembling starlight of the skies \n","he saw there mirrored shimmering. \n","tinviel the elven-fair, \n","\n","immortal maiden elven-wise, \n","\n","about him cast her shadowy hair \n","and arms like silver glimmering. \n","\n","long was the way that fate them bore, \n","o'er stony mountains cold and grey, \n","through halls of iron and darkling door, \n","and woods of nightshade morrowless. \n","the sundering seas between them lay, \n","and yet at last they met once more, \n","\n","and long ago they passed away \n","in the forest singing sorrowless. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","strider sighed and paused before he spoke again. 'that is a song,' he \n","said, 'in the mode that is called ann-thennath among the elves, but is hard \n","to render in our common speech, and this is but a rough echo of it. it tells \n","of the meeting of beren son of barahir and lthien tinviel. beren was a \n","mortal man, but lthien was the daughter of thingol, a king of elves upon \n","middle-earth when the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that \n","has ever been among all the children of this world. as the stars above the \n","mists of the northern lands was her loveliness, and in her face was a \n","shining light. in those days the great enemy, of whom sauron of mordor was \n","but a servant, dwelt in angband in the north, and the elves of the west \n","coming back to middle-earth made war upon him to regain the silmarils which \n","he had stolen; and the fathers of men aided the elves. but the enemy was \n","victorious and barahir was slain, and beren escaping through great peril \n","came over the mountains of terror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the \n","forest of neldoreth. there he beheld lthien singing and dancing in a glade \n","beside the enchanted river esgalduin; and he named her tinviel, that is \n","nightingale in the language of old. many sorrows befell them afterwards, and \n","they were parted long. tinviel rescued beren from the dungeons of sauron, \n","and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the great \n","enemy from his throne, and took from his iron crown one of the three \n","silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price of lthien to \n","thingol her father. yet at the last beren was slain by the wolf that came \n","from the gates of angband, and he died in the arms of tinviel. but she \n","chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow him; \n","and it is sung that they met again beyond the sundering seas, and after a \n","brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, \n","long ago, beyond the confines of this world. so it is that lthien tinviel \n","alone of the elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have \n","lost her whom they most loved. but from her the lineage of the elf-lords of \n","old descended among men. there live still those of whom lthien was the \n","foremother, and it is said that her line shall never fail. elrond of \n","rivendell is of that kin. for of beren and lthien was born dior thingol's \n","heir; and of him elwing the white whom edrendil wedded, he that sailed his \n","ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the silmaril \n","upon his brow. and of edrendil came the kings of nmenor, that is \n","westernesse.' \n","\n","as strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","in the red glow of the wood-fire. his eyes shone, and his voice was rich and \n","deep. above him was a black starry sky. suddenly a pale light appeared over \n","the crown of weathertop behind him. the waxing moon was climbing \n","slowly \n","\n","above the hill that overshadowed them, and the stars above the hill-top \n","faded. \n","\n","the story ended. the hobbits moved and stretched. 'look!' said merry. \n","'the moon is rising: it must be getting late.' \n","\n","the others looked up. even as they did so, they saw on the top of the \n","hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise. it was \n","perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light. \n","\n","sam and merry got up and walked away from the fire. frodo and pippin \n","remained seated in silence. strider was watching the moonlight on the hill \n","intently. all seemed quiet and still, but frodo felt a cold dread creeping \n","over his heart, now that strider was no longer speaking. he huddled closer \n","to the fire. at that moment sam came running back from the edge of the dell. \n","\n","'i don't know what it is,' he said, 'but i suddenly felt afraid. i \n","durstn't go outside this dell for any money; i felt that something was \n","creeping up the slope.' \n","\n","'did you see anything?' asked frodo, springing to his feet. \n","\n","'no, sir. i saw nothing, but i didn't stop to look.' \n","\n","'i saw something,' said merry; 'or i thought i did - away westwards \n","where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the \n","hill-tops, i thought there were two or three black shapes. they seemed to be \n","moving this way.' \n","\n","'keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!' cried strider. 'get \n","some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!' \n","\n","for a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with their \n","backs turned to the wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled \n","them. nothing happened. there was no sound or movement in the night. \n","frodo \n","\n","stirred, feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out \n","aloud. \n","\n","'hush!' whispered strider. 'what's that?' gasped pippin at the same \n","moment. \n","\n","over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they \n","felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. they \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. soon there could be no \n","doubt: \n","\n","three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope, \n","looking down on them. so black were they that they seemed like black holes \n","in the deep shade behind them. frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as \n","of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. then the shapes slowly \n","advanced. \n","\n","terror overcame pippin and merry, and they threw themselves flat on the \n","ground. sam shrank to frodo's side. frodo was hardly less terrified than his \n","companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was \n","swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring. the desire to do \n","this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. fie did not forget \n","the barrow, nor the message of gandalf; but something seemed to be \n","compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield. not with \n","the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt \n","that he must take the ring and put it on his finger. fie could not speak. fie \n","felt sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great \n","trouble, but he could not turn towards him. he shut his eyes and struggled \n","for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly drew \n","out the chain, and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left hand. \n","\n","immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, \n","the shapes became terribly clear. he was able to see beneath their black \n","wrappings. there were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the \n","dell, three advancing. in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; \n","under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms \n","of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel. their eyes fell on \n","him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. desperate, he drew his own \n","sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. \n","\n","two of the figures halted. the third was taller than the others: his hair \n","was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. in one hand he held a \n","long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held \n","it glowed with a pale light. he sprang forward and bore down on frodo. \n","\n","at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard \n","himself crying aloud: o elbereth! gilthoniel! at the same time he struck at \n","the feet of his enemy. a shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a \n","pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. even as he \n","swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse of strider leaping \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. with a last \n","effort frodo, dropping his sword, slipped the ring from his finger and \n","closed his right hand tight upon it. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 12 . flight to the ford \n","\n","\n","\n","when frodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring desperately. \n","\n","he was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning brightly. his \n","three companions were bending over him. 'what has happened? where is the \n","pale king?' he asked wildly. they were too overjoyed to hear him speak to \n","answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. at length he \n","gathered from sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes \n","coming towards them. suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had \n","vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. he \n","heard frodo's voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from \n","under the earth, crying out strange words. they saw nothing more, until they \n","stumbled over the body of frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the \n","grass with his sword beneath him. strider ordered them to pick him up and \n","lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. that was now a good while \n","ago. \n","\n","sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about strider; but while \n","they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows. they \n","started, and sam drew his sword and stood over frodo; but strider knelt down \n","swiftly at his side. \n","\n","'i am not a black rider, sam,' he said gently, 'nor in league with \n","them. i have been trying to discover something of their movements; but i \n","have found nothing. i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack \n","again. but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.' \n","\n","when he heard what frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and \n","shook his head and sighed. then he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much \n","water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. \n","\n","'keep the fire going well, and keep frodo warm!' he said. then he got up and \n","walked away, and called sam to him. 'i think i understand things better \n","now,' he said in a low voice. 'there seem only to have been five of the \n","enemy. why they were not all here, i don't know; but i don't think they \n","expected to be resisted. they have drawn off for the time being. but not \n","far, i fear. they will come again another night, if we cannot escape. they \n","are only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost \n","accomplished, and that the ring cannot fly much further. i fear, sam, that \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their \n","will. we shall see!' sam choked with tears. 'don't despair!' said strider. \n","\n","'you must trust me now. your frodo is made of sterner stuff than i had \n","guessed, though gandalf hinted that it might prove so. he is not slain, and \n","i think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies \n","expect. i will do all i can to help and heal him. guard him well, while i am \n","away!' he hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness. \n","\n","frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a \n","deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. his \n","friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound. the night \n","passed slowly and wearily. dawn was growing in the sky, and the dell was \n","filling with grey light, when strider at last returned. \n","\n","'look!' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak \n","that had lain there hidden by the darkness. a foot above the lower hem there \n","was a slash. 'this was the stroke of frodo's sword,' he said. 'the only hurt \n","that it did to his enemy, i fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish \n","that pierce that dreadful king. more deadly to him was the name of \n","elbereth.' \n","\n","'and more deadly to frodo was this!' he stooped again and lifted up a \n","long thin knife. there was a cold gleam in it. as strider raised it they saw \n","that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off. but \n","even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for \n","the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only \n","the hilt in strider's hand. 'alas!' he cried. 'it was this accursed knife \n","that gave the wound. few now have the skill in healing to match such evil \n","weapons. but i will do what i can.' \n","\n","he sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger -hilt laid it on his \n","knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. then setting it \n","aside, he turned to frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could \n","not catch. from the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a \n","plant. \n","\n","'these leaves,' he said, 'i have walked far to find; for this plant \n","does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the road \n","i found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.' he crushed a leaf in his \n","fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. 'it is fortunate \n","that i could find it, for it is a healing plant that the men of the west \n","brought to middle-earth. athelas they named it, and it grows now sparsely \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known \n","in the north, except to some of those who wander in the wild. it has great \n","virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.' \n","\n","he threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodo's shoulder. the \n","fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their \n","minds calmed and cleared. the herb had also some power over the wound, for \n","frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; \n","but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his \n","hand. he bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for \n","weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the ring he obeyed \n","not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. he wondered if he \n","would remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue \n","their journey. he fell too weak to stand. \n","\n","the others were discussing this very question. they quickly decided to \n","leave weathertop as soon as possible. 'i think now,' said strider, 'that the \n","enemy has been watching this place for some days. if gandalf ever came here, \n","then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return. in any \n","case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, \n","and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.' \n","\n","as soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and \n","packed. it was impossible for frodo to walk, so they divided the greater \n","part of their baggage among the four of them, and put frodo on the pony. in \n","the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed \n","fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, \n","especially for sam. bill ferny's treatment must have been very hard for the \n","journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life. \n","\n","they started off in a southerly direction. this would mean crossing the \n","road, but. it was the quickest way to more wooded country. and they needed \n","fuel; for strider said that frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, \n","while fire would be some protection for them all. it was also his plan to \n","shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the road: east \n","beyond weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards. \n","\n","they made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western \n","slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of the road. \n","\n","there was no sign of the riders. but even as they were hurrying across they \n","heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering. \n","trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","land before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; \n","bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in \n","between. the grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the \n","thickets were faded and falling. it was a cheerless land, and their journey \n","was slow and gloomy. they spoke little as they trudged along. frodo's heart \n","was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, \n","and \n","\n","their backs bowed under their burdens. even strider seemed tired and \n","heavy-hearted. \n","\n","before the first day's march was over frodo's pain began to grow again, \n","but he did not speak of it for a long time. four days passed, without the \n","ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them weathertop \n","slowly \n","\n","sank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer. yet \n","since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked \n","their flight or followed them. they dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch \n","in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the \n","grey night, dimly lit by the cloud- veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and \n","heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. not once did they \n","feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in \n","the dell. it seemed too much to hope that the riders had already lost their \n","trail again. perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow \n","place? \n","\n","at the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly \n","out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended. strider now \n","turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached \n","the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded \n","hills. away below them they could see the road sweeping round the feet of \n","the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin \n","sunshine. in the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley \n","half-veiled in mist. \n","\n","\"i am afraid we must go back to the road here for a while,' said \n","strider. 'we have now come to the river hoarwell, that the elves call \n","mitheithel. it flows down out of the ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of \n","rivendell, and joins the loud water away in the south. some call it the \n","greyflood after that. it is a great water before it finds the sea. there is \n","no way over it below its sources in the ettenmoors, except by the last \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","bridge on which the road crosses.' \n","\n","'what is that other river we can see far away there?' asked merry. \n","\n","'that is loudwater, the bruinen of rivendell,' answered strider. 'the \n","road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the bridge to the \n","ford of bruinen. but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water. \n","one river at a time! we shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the last \n","bridge held against us.' \n","\n","next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of \n","the road. sam and strider went forward, but they found no sign of any \n","travellers or riders. here under the shadow of the hills there had been some \n","rain. strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away \n","all footprints. no horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see. \n","\n","they hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile \n","or two they saw the last bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope. \n","they dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. strider \n","made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the road, while he went \n","forward to explore. \n","\n","before long he came hurrying back. 'i can see no sign of the enemy,' he \n","said, 'and i wonder very much what that means. but i have found something \n","very strange.' \n","\n","he held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. 'i found it \n","in the mud in the middle of the bridge,' he said. 'it is a beryl, an \n","elf-stone. whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, i cannot say; \n","but it brings hope to me. i will take it as a sign that we may pass the \n","bridge; but beyond that i dare not keep to the road, without some clearer \n","token.' \n","\n","at once they went on again. they crossed the bridge in safety, hearing \n","no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches. a mile \n","further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the \n","steep lands on the left of the road. here strider turned aside, and soon \n","they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of \n","sullen hills. \n","\n","the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous \n","road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. as \n","they went forward the hills about them steadily rose. here and there upon \n","heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the \n","ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. frodo, who was not walking, had \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","time to gaze ahead and to think. he recalled bilbo's account of his journey \n","and the threatening towers on the hills north of the road, in the country \n","near the troll's wood where his first serious adventure had happened. frodo \n","guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance \n","they would pass near the spot. \n","\n","'who lives in this land?' he asked. 'and who built these towers? is \n","this troll-country?' \n","\n","'no!' said strider. 'trolls do not build. no one lives in this land. \n","\n","men once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now. they became an evil \n","people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of angmar. but all \n","were destroyed in the war that brought the north kingdom to its end. but \n","that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow \n","still lies on the land.' \n","\n","'where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and \n","forgetful?' asked peregrin. 'the birds and beasts do not tell tales of that \n","son.' \n","\n","'the heirs of elendil do not forget all things past,' said strider; \n","\n","'and many more things than i can tell are remembered in rivendell.' 'have \n","you often been to rivendell?' said frodo. 'i have,' said strider. 'i dwelt \n","there once, and still i return when i may. \n","\n","there my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the \n","fair house of elrond.' \n","\n","the hills now began to shut them in. the road behind held on its way to \n","the river bruinen, but both were now hidden from view. the travellers came \n","into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent. trees with old \n","and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes \n","of pine-wood. \n","\n","the hobbits grew very weary. they advanced slowly, for they had to pick \n","their way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled \n","rocks. as long as they could they avoided climbing for frodo's sake, and \n","because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales. \n","\n","they had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. the wind \n","began to blow steadily out of the west and pour the water of the distant \n","seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain. by nightfall \n","they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get \n","any fire to burn. the next day the hills rose still higher and steeper \n","before them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","course. strider seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out \n","from weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low. it \n","went on raining. \n","\n","that night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock -wall behind them, \n","in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff. frodo was \n","restless. the cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and \n","the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep. he lay tossing and \n","turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks \n","of rock, water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened \n","stone. he felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him; but when he \n","sat up he saw nothing but the back of strider sitting hunched up, smoking \n","his pipe, and watching. he lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream, \n","in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the shire, but it seemed \n","faint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking \n","over the hedge. \n","\n","in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped. the clouds \n","were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips of blue appeared \n","between them. the wind was shifting again. they did not start early. \n","immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off \n","alone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he \n","came back. he was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie \n","of the land. \n","\n","when he returned he was not reassuring. 'we have come too far to the \n","north,' he said, 'and we must find some way to turn back southwards again. \n","\n","if we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the ettendales far north \n","of rivendell. that is troll-country, and little known to me. we could \n","perhaps find our way through and come round to rivendell from the north; but \n","it would take too long, for i do not know the way, and our food would not \n","last. so somehow or other we must find the ford of bruinen.' \n","\n","the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. they \n","found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running \n","south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of \n","the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark \n","edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a \n","blunted saw. they had a choice between going back or climbing over it. \n","\n","they decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. before \n","long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot. even so they \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for \n","themselves, burdened as they were. the light was nearly gone, and they were \n","all exhausted, when at last they reached the top. they had climbed on to a \n","narrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away \n","again, only a short distance ahead. frodo threw himself down, and lay on the \n","ground shivering. his left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt \n","as if icy claws were laid upon them. the trees and rocks about him seemed \n","shadowy and dim. \n","\n","'we cannot go any further,' said merry to strider. 'i am afraid this \n","has been too much for frodo. i am dreadfully anxious about him. what are we \n","to do? do you think they will be able to cure him in ri vendell, if we ever \n","get there?' \n","\n","'we shall see,' answered strider. 'there is nothing more that i can do \n","in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that i am so \n","anxious to press on. but i agree that we can go no further tonight.' \n","\n","'what is the matter with my master?' asked sam in a low voice, looking \n","appealingly at strider. 'his wound was small, and it is already closed. \n","\n","there's nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.' \n","\n","'frodo has been touched by the weapons of the enemy,' said strider, \n","\n","'and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive \n","out. but do not give up hope, sam!' \n","\n","night was cold up on the high ridge. they lit a small fire down under \n","the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as \n","if stone had once been quarried there. they sat huddled together. the wind \n","blew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning \n","and sighing. frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings \n","were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought \n","him in all the hollows of the hill s. \n","\n","the morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light \n","pale and clear in a rain- washed sky. their hearts were encouraged, but (hey \n","longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs. as soon as it was light, \n","strider took merry with him and went to survey the country from the height \n","to the east of the pass. the sun had risen and was shining brightly when he \n","returned with more comforting news. they were now going more or less in the \n","right direction. if they went on, down the further side of the ridge, they \n","would have the mountains on their left. some way ahead strider had caught a \n","glimpse of the loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","view, the road to the ford was not far from the river and lay on the side \n","nearest to them. \n","\n","'we must make for the road again,' he said. 'we cannot hope to find a \n","path through these hills. whatever danger may beset it, the road is our only \n","way to the ford.' \n","\n","as soon as they had eaten they set out again. they climbed slowly down \n","the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had \n","expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long \n","frodo was able to ride again. bill ferny's poor old pony was developing an \n","unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many \n","jolts as possible. the spirits of the party rose again. even frodo felt \n","better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to \n","obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes. \n","\n","pippin was a little ahead of the others. suddenly he turned round and \n","called to them. 'there is a path here!' he cried. \n","\n","when they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake: \n","\n","there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many \n","windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind. in \n","places it was now faint and overgrown, or choked with fallen stones and \n","trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used. it was a path made \n","by strong arms and heavy feet. here and there old trees had been cut or \n","broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way. \n","\n","they followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest \n","way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came \n","into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer and broader. suddenly coming \n","out of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply \n","to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill. when they came \n","to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level \n","strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees. in the stony wall \n","there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge. \n","\n","outside the door they all halted. there was a cave or rock-chamber \n","behind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen. strider, sam, and \n","merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little \n","wider, and then strider and merry went in. they did not go far, for on the \n","floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance \n","except some great empty jars and broken pots. \n","\n","'surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!' said pippin. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'come out, you two, and let us get away. now we know who made the path - \n","and \n","\n","we had better get off it quick.' \n","\n","'there is no need, i think,' said strider, coining out. 'it is \n","certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken. i don't \n","think we need be afraid. but let us go on down warily, and we shall see.' \n","\n","the path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again \n","across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. pippin, not liking \n","to show strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with merry. sam and \n","strider came behind, one on each side of frodo's pony, for the path was now \n","broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. but they had not gone \n","very far before pippin came running back, followed by merry. they both \n","looked terrified. \n","\n","'there are trolls!' pippin panted. 'down in a clearing in the woods not \n","far below. we got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. they are very \n","large!' \n","\n","'we will come and look at them,' said strider, picking up a stick. \n","\n","frodo said nothing, but sam looked scared. \n","\n","the sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped \n","branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of light. \n","\n","they halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, \n","holding their breath. there stood the trolls: three large trolls. one was \n","stooping, and the other two stood staring at him. \n","\n","strider walked forward unconcernedly. 'get up, old stone!' he said, and \n","broke his stick upon the stooping troll. \n","\n","nothing happened. there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, \n","and then even frodo laughed. 'well!' he said. 'we are forgetting our family \n","history! these must be the very three that were caught by gandalf, \n","quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.' \n","\n","'i had no idea we were anywhere near the place!' said pippin. he knew \n","the story well. bilbo and frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact \n","he had never more than half believed it. even now he looked at the stone \n","trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them \n","to life again. \n","\n","'you are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew \n","about trolls,' said strider. 'it is broad daylight with a bright sun, and \n","yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","us in this glade! in any case you might have noticed that one of them has an \n","old bird's nest behind his ear. that would be a most unusual ornament for a \n","live troll!' \n","\n","they all laughed. frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of \n","bilbo's first successful adventure was heartening. the sun, too, was warm \n","and comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little. \n","they rested for some time in the glade, and took their mid-day meal right \n","under the shadow of the trolls' large legs. \n","\n","'won't somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?' said \n","merry, when they had finished. 'we haven't had a song or a tale for days.' \n","\n","'not since weathertop,' said frodo. the others looked at him. 'don't \n","worry about me!' he added. 'i feel much better, but i don't think i could \n","sing. perhaps sam could dig something out of his memory.' \n","\n","'come on, sam!' said merry. 'there's more stored in your head than you \n","let on about.' \n","\n","'i don't know about that,' said sam. 'but how would this suit? it ain't \n","what i call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense. but \n","these old images here brought it to my mind.' standing up, with his hands \n","behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune. \n","\n","troll sat alone on his seat of stone, \n","\n","and munched and mumbled a bare old bone; \n","\n","for many a year he had gnawed it near, \n","\n","for meat was hard to come by. \n","\n","done by! gum by! \n","\n","in a case in the hills he dwelt alone, \n","\n","and meat was hard to come by. \n","\n","up came tom with his big boots on. \n","\n","said he to troll: 'pray, what is yon? \n","\n","for it looks like the shin o' my nuncle tim, \n","\n","as should be a-lyin ' in graveyard. \n","\n","caveyard! paveyard! \n","\n","this many a year has tim been gone, \n","\n","and i thought he were lyin ' in graveyard. ' \n","\n","\n","\n","'my lad, ' said troll, 'this bone i stole. \n","but what be bones that lie in a hole? \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","thy nuncle was dead as a lump o' lead, \n","\n","afore i found his shinbone. \n","\n","tinbone! thinbone! \n","\n","he can spare a share for a poor old troll, \n","\n","for he don't need his shinbone. ' \n","\n","said tom: 7 don't see why the likes o' thee \n","without axin ' leave should go makin 'free \n","with the shank or the shin o' my father's kin; \n","so hand the old bone over! \n","\n","rover! trover! \n","\n","though dead he be, it belongs to he; \n","\n","so hand the old bone over!' \n","\n","'for a couple o' pins,' says troll, and grins, \n","'i'll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins. \n","\n","a bit o' fresh meal will go down sweet! \n","\n","i'll try my teeth on thee now. \n","\n","hee now! see now! \n","\n","i'm tired o' gnawing old bones and skins; \n","\n","i've a mind to dine on thee now. ' \n","\n","but just as he thought his dinner was caught, \n","he found his hands had hold of naught. \n","\n","before he could mind, tom slipped behind \n","and gave him the boot to lam him. \n","\n","warn him! darn him! \n","\n","a bump o' the boot on the seat, tom thought, \n","would be the way to lam him. \n","\n","but harder than stone is the flesh and bone \n","of a troll that sits in the hills alone. \n","\n","as well set your boot to the mountain's root, \n","for the seat of a troll don 't feel it. \n","\n","peel it! heal it! \n","\n","old troll laughed, when he heard tom groan, \n","and he knew his toes could feel it. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","tom's leg is game, since home he came, \n","\n","and his bootless foot is lasting lame; \n","\n","but troll don't care, and he's still there \n","\n","with the bone he boned from its owner. \n","\n","doner! boner! \n","\n","troll's old seat is still the same, \n","\n","and the bone he boned from its owner! \n","\n","'well, that's a warning to us all!' laughed merry. 'it is as well you \n","used a stick, and not your hand, strider!' \n","\n","'where did you come by that, sam?' asked pippin. 'i've never heard \n","those words before.' \n","\n","sam muttered something inaudible. 'it's out of his own head, of \n","course,' said frodo. 'i am learning a lot about sam gamgee on this journey. \n","first he was a conspirator, now he's a jester. he'll end up by becoming a \n","wizard - or a warrior!' \n","\n","'i hope not,' said sam. 'i don't want to be neither!' \n","\n","in the afternoon they went on down the woods. they were probably \n","following the very track that gandalf, bilbo, and the dwarves had used many \n","years before. after a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank \n","above the road. at this point the road had left the hoarwell far behind in \n","its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and \n","winding eastward among woods and heather -covered slopes towards the ford \n","and \n","\n","the mountains. not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the \n","grass. on it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen \n","dwarf-runes and secret marks. \n","\n","'there!' said merry. 'that must be the stone that marked the place \n","where the trolls' gold was hidden. how much is left of bilbo's share, i \n","wonder, frodo?' \n","\n","frodo looked at the stone, and wished that bilbo had brought home no \n","treasure more perilous, nor less easy to pan with. 'none at all,' he said. \n","\n","'bilbo gave it all away. he told me he did not feel it was really his, as it \n","came from robbers.' \n","\n","the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. there was \n","no sign of any other travellers to be seen. as there was now no other \n","possible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank, and turning \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","left went off as fast as they could. soon a shoulder of the hills cut off \n","the light of the fast westering sun. a cold wind flowed down to meet them \n","from the mountains ahead. \n","\n","they were beginning to look out for a place off the road, where they \n","could camp for the night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear \n","back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them. they looked back, \n","but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the \n","road. as quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into \n","the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came \n","to a small patch of thick-growing hazels. as they peered out from among the \n","bushes, they could see the road, faint and grey in the failing light, some \n","thirty feel below them. the sound of hoofs drew nearer. they were going \n","fast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. then faintly, as if it was blown \n","away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of \n","small bells tinkling. \n","\n","that does not sound like a black rider's horse!' said frodo, listening \n","intently. the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all \n","remained full of suspicion. they had been in fear of pursuit for so long \n","that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly. but strider was \n","now leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a \n","look of joy on his face. \n","\n","the light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. clearer \n","and nearer now the bells jingled, and clippety-clip came the quick trotting \n","feet. suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, \n","running swiftly. in the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it \n","were studded with gems like living stars. the rider's cloak streamed behind \n","him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the \n","wind of his speed. to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining \n","through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil. \n","\n","strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road, leaping \n","with a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved or called, the \n","rider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up towards the thicket \n","where they stood. when he saw strider, he dismounted and ran to meet him \n","calling out: ai na vedui dnadan! mae govannen! his speech and clear \n","ringing \n","\n","voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the elven-folk. no \n","others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear. but there \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was \n","now speaking quickly and urgently to strider. \n","\n","soon strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the bushes and \n","hurried down to the road. 'this is glorfindel, who dwells in the house of \n","elrond,' said strider. \n","\n","'hail, and well met at last!' said the elf-lord to frodo. 'i was sent \n","from rivendell to look for you. we feared that you were in danger upon the \n","road.' \n","\n","'then gandalf has reached rivendell?' cried frodo joyfully. \n","\n","'no. he had not when i departed; but that was nine days ago,' answered \n","glorfindel. 'elrond received news that troubled him. some of my kindred, \n","journeying in your land beyond the baranduin,* learned that things were \n","amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could. they said that the nine \n","were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without \n","guidance, for gandalf had not returned. there are few even in rivendell that \n","can ride openly against the nine; but such as there were, elrond sent out \n","north, west, and south. it was thought that you might turn far aside to \n","avoid pursuit, and become lost in the wilderness. \n","\n","'it was my lot to take the road, and i came to the bridge of \n","mitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago. three of the \n","servants of sauron were upon the bridge, but they withdrew and i pursued \n","them westward. i came also upon two others, but they turned away southward. \n","since then i have searched for your trail. two days ago i found it, and \n","followed it over the bridge; and today i marked where you descended from the \n","hills again. but come! there is no time for further news. since you are here \n","we must risk the peril of the road and go. there are five behind us, and \n","when they find your trail upon the road they will ride after us like the \n","wind. and they are not all. where the other four may be, i do not know. i \n","fear that we may find the ford is already held against us.' \n","\n","while glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened. frodo \n","felt a great weariness come over him. ever since the sun began to sink the \n","mist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt that a shadow was coming \n","between him and the faces of his friends. now pain assailed him, and he felt \n","cold. he swayed, clutching at sam's arm. \n","\n","'my master is sick and wounded,' said sam angrily. 'he can't go on \n","riding after nightfall. he needs rest.' \n","\n","glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety. \n","\n","briefly strider told of the attack on their camp under weathertop, and \n","of the deadly knife. he drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it \n","to the elf. glorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he looked intently at \n","it. \n","\n","'there are evil things written on this hilt,' he said; 'though maybe \n","your eyes cannot see them. keep it, aragorn, till we reach the house of \n","elrond! but be wary, and handle it as little as you may! alas! the wounds of \n","this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. i will do what i can - but all the \n","more do i urge you now to go on without rest.' \n","\n","he searched the wound on frodo's shoulder with his fingers, and his \n","face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him. but frodo felt the \n","chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his \n","shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. the dusk of evening seemed \n","to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. he saw his \n","friends' faces more clearly again, and a measure of new hope and strength \n","returned. \n","\n","'you shall ride my horse,' said glorfindel. 'i will shorten the \n","stirrups up to the saddle-skins, and you must sit as tight as you can. but \n","you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that i command him \n","to bear. his pace is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he \n","will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy \n","cannot rival.' \n","\n","'no, he will not!' said frodo. 'i shall not ride him, if i am to be \n","carried off to rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in \n","danger.' \n","\n","glorfindel smiled. 'i doubt very much,' he said, 'if your friends would \n","be in danger if you were not with them! the pursuit would follow you and \n","leave us in peace, i think. it is you, frodo, and that which you bear that \n","brings us all in peril.' \n","\n","to that frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount glorfindel's \n","white horse. the pony was laden instead with a great part of the others' \n","burdens, so that they now marched lighter, and for a time made good speed; \n","but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless \n","feet of the elf. on he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on \n","under the deep clouded night. there was neither star nor moon. not until the \n","grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. pippin, merry, and sam were by that \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even strider seemed by the \n","sag of his shoulders to be weary. frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream. \n","\n","they cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the \n","road-side, and fell asleep immediately. they seemed hardly to have closed \n","their eyes when glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while they slept, \n","awoke them again. the sun had now climbed far into the morning, and the \n","clouds and mists of the night were gone. \n","\n","'drink this!' said glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a \n","little liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather. it was clear as \n","spring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in \n","the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as \n","they drank it. eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit \n","(which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better \n","than many a good breakfast in the shire had done. \n","\n","they had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the road \n","again. glorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed two brief halts \n","during the day's march. in this way they covered almost twenty miles before \n","nightfall, and came to a point where the road bent right and ran down \n","towards the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the bruinen. so \n","far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or \n","hear; but often glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they \n","lagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face. once or twice he \n","spoke to strider in the elf-tongue. \n","\n","but however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the \n","hobbits could go no further that night. they were stumbling along dizzy with \n","weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs. frodo's \n","pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows of \n","ghostly grey. he almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world \n","seemed less pale and empty. \n","\n","the hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next \n","morning. there were many miles yet to go between them and the ford, and \n","they \n","\n","hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage. \n","\n","'our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,' said \n","glorfindel; 'for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us, \n","and other danger may be waiting by the ford.' \n","\n","the road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","places much grass at either side, in which the hobbits walked when they \n","could, to ease their tired feet. in the late afternoon they came to a place \n","where the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and \n","then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. echoes \n","ran along as they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many \n","footfalls following their own. all at once, as if through a gate of light, \n","the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open. there at \n","the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and \n","beyond that the ford of rivendell. on the further side was a steep brown \n","bank, threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains \n","climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky. \n","\n","there was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind \n","them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the \n","branches of the pines. one moment glorfindel turned and listened, then he \n","sprang forward with a loud cry. \n","\n","'fly!' he called. 'fly! the enemy is upon us!' \n","\n","the white horse leaped forward. the hobbits ran down the slope. \n","glorfindel and strider followed as rear -guard. they were only half way \n","across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. out of \n","the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a black rider. he reined \n","his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle. another followed him, and \n","then another; then again two more. \n","\n","'ride forward! ride!' cried glorfindel to frodo. \n","\n","he did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. checking \n","the horse to a walk, he turned and looked back. the riders seemed to sit \n","upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark and \n","solid, while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist. \n","suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to \n","wait. then at once fear and hatred awoke in him. his hand left the bridle \n","and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it. \n","\n","'ride on! ride on!' cried glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called \n","to the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, asfaloth! \n","\n","at once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the \n","last lap of the road. at the same moment the black horses leaped down the \n","hill in pursuit, and from the riders came a terrible cry, such as frodo had \n","heard filling the woods with horror in the eastfarthing far away. it was \n","answered; and to the dismay of frodo and his friends out from the trees and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","rocks away on the left four other riders came flying. two rode towards \n","frodo: two galloped madly towards the ford to cut off his escape. they \n","seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as \n","their courses converged with his. \n","\n","frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. he could no longer \n","see his friends. the riders behind were falling back: even their great \n","steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of glorfindel. he \n","looked forward again, and hope faded. there seemed no chance of reaching the \n","ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush. he could \n","see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black \n","cloaks, and they were robed in white and grey. swords were naked in their \n","pale hands; helms were on their heads. their cold eyes glittered, and they \n","called to him with fell voices. \n","\n","fear now filled all frodo's mind. he thought no longer of his sword. no \n","cry came from him. he shut his eyes and clung to the horse's mane. the wind \n","whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill. a \n","breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a \n","flash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed right \n","before the face of the foremost rider. \n","\n","frodo heard the splash of water. it foamed about his feet. he felt the \n","quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony \n","path. he was climbing the steep bank. he was across the ford. \n","\n","but the pursuers were close behind. at the top of the bank the horse \n","halted and turned about neighing fiercely. there were nine riders at the \n","water's edge below, and frodo's spirit quailed before the threat of their \n","uplifted faces. he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as \n","easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over \n","the long uncertain path from the ford to the edge of rivendell, if once the \n","riders crossed. in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt. \n","hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse. \n","\n","suddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse forward. it checked at \n","the water and reared up. with a great effort frodo sat upright and \n","brandished his sword. \n","\n","'go back!' he cried. 'go back to the land of mordor, and follow me no \n","more! ' his voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears. the riders \n","halted, but frodo had not the power of bombadil. his enemies laughed at him \n","with a harsh and chilling laughter. 'come back! come back!' they called. 'to \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","mordor we will take you!' \n","\n","'go back!' he whispered. \n","\n","the ring! the ring!' they cried with deadly voices; and immediately \n","their leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by two \n","others. \n","\n","'by elbereth and lthien the fair,' said frodo with a last effort, \n","lifting up his sword, 'you shall have neither the ring nor me!' \n","\n","then the leader, who was now half across the ford, stood up menacing in \n","his stirrups, and raised up his hand. frodo was stricken dumb. he felt his \n","tongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart labouring. his sword broke and \n","fell out of his shaking hand. the elf-horse reared and snorted. the foremost \n","of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore. \n","\n","at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud \n","waters rolling many stones. dimly frodo saw the river below him rise, and \n","down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves. white flames \n","seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw \n","amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. the three \n","riders that were still in the midst of the ford were overwhelmed: they \n","disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam. those that were behind drew \n","back in dismay. \n","\n","with his last failing senses frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him \n","that he saw, beyond the riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure \n","of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that \n","flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world. \n","\n","the black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in \n","terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood. their piercing cries \n","were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away. then frodo \n","felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and \n","engulf him together with his enemies. he heard and saw no more. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","* book ii * \n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 1 . many meetings \n","\n","frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. at first he thought that he \n","had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge \n","of memory. or perhaps he had been ill? but the ceiling looked strange; it \n","was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. he lay a little while longer \n","looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of a \n","waterfall. \n","\n","'where am i, and what is the time?' he said aloud to the ceiling. 'in \n","the house of elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning.' said a voice. \n","\n","'it is the morning of october the twenty -fourth, if you want to know.' \n","\n","'gandalf!' cried frodo, sitting up. there was the old wizard, sitting \n","in a chair by the open window. \n","\n","'yes,' he said, 'i am here. and you are lucky to be here, too, after \n","all the absurd things you have done since you left home.' frodo lay down \n","again. he felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did \n","not think he would get the better of an argument. he was fully awake now, \n","and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous 'short cut' \n","through the old forest the 'accident' at the prancing pony ; and his madness \n","in putting on the ring in the dell under weathertop. while he was thinking \n","of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his \n","arriving in rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft \n","puffs of gandalf s pipe, as he blew white smoke -rings out of the window. \n","\n","'where's sam?' frodo asked at length. 'and are the others all right?' \n","\n","'yes, they are all safe and sound,' answered gandalf. 'sam was here \n","until i sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.' \n","\n","'what happened at the ford?' said frodo. 'it all seemed so dim somehow; \n","and it still does.' \n","\n","'yes, it would. you were beginning to fade,' answered gandalf. 'the \n","wound was overcoming you at last. a few more hours and you would have \n","been \n","\n","beyond our aid. but you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! as you \n","showed in the barrow. that was touch and go: perhaps the most dangerous \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","moment of all. i wish you could have held out at weathertop.' \n","\n","'you seem to know a great deal already,' said frodo. 'i have not spoken \n","to the others about the barrow. at first it was too horrible; and afterwards \n","there were other things to think about. how do you know about it?' \n","\n","'you have talked long in your sleep, frodo,' said gandalf gently, 'and \n","it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory. do not worry! \n","though i said \"absurd\" just now, i did not mean it. i think well of you-and \n","of the others. it is no small feat to have come so far, and through such \n","dangers, still bearing the ring.' \n","\n","'we should never have done it without strider,' said frodo. 'but we \n","needed you. i did not know what to do without you.' \n","\n","'i was delayed,' said gandalf, 'and that nearly proved our ruin. and \n","yet i am not sure; it may have been better so.' \n","\n","'i wish you would tell me what happened!' \n","\n","'all in good time! you are not supposed to talk or worry about anything \n","today, by elrond's orders.' \n","\n","'but talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which are quite as \n","tiring,' said frodo. 'i am wide awake now, and i remember so many things \n","that want explaining. why were you delayed? you ought to tell me that at \n","least.' \n","\n","'you will soon hear all you wish to know,' said gandalf. 'we shall have \n","a council, as soon as you are well enough. at the moment i will only say \n","that i was held captive.' \n","\n","'you?' cried frodo. \n","\n","'yes, i, gandalf the grey,' said the wizard solemnly. 'there are many \n","powers in the world, for good or for evil. some are greater than i am. \n","against some i have not yet been measured. but my time is coming. the \n","morgul-lord and his black riders have come forth. war is preparing!' \n","\n","'then you knew of the riders already -before i met them?' \n","\n","'yes, i knew of them. indeed i spoke of them once to you; for the black \n","riders are the ringwraiths, the nine servants of the lord of the rings. but \n","i did not know that they had arisen again or i should have fled with you at \n","once. i heard news of them only after i left you in june; but that story \n","must wait. for the moment we have been saved from disaster, by aragorn.' \n","\n","'yes,' said frodo, 'it was strider that saved us. yet i was afraid of \n","him at first. sam never quite trusted him. i think, not at any rate until we \n","met glorfindel.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","gandalf smiled. v i have heard all about sam,' he said. 'he has no more \n","doubts now.' \n","\n","'i am glad,' said frodo. 'for i have become very fond of strider. well, \n","fond is not the right word. i mean he is dear to me; though he is strange, \n","and grim at times. in fact, he reminds me often of you. i didn't know that \n","any of the big people were like that. i thought, well, that they were just \n","big, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like butterbur; or stupid and wicked \n","like bill ferny. but then we don't know much about men in the shire, except \n","perhaps the breelanders.' \n","\n","'you don't know much even about them, if you think old barliman is \n","stupid,' said gandalf. 'he is wise enough on his own ground. he thinks less \n","than he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick wall in time (as \n","they say in bree). but there are few left in middle-earth like aragorn son \n","of arathorn. the race of the kings from over the sea is nearly at an end. it \n","may be that this war of the ring will be their last adventure.' \n","\n","'do you really mean that strider is one of the people of the old \n","kings?' said frodo in wonder. 'i thought they had all vanished long ago. i \n","thought he was only a ranger.' \n","\n","'only a ranger!' cried gandalf. 'my dear frodo, that is just what the \n","rangers are: the last remnant in the north of the great people, the men of \n","the west. they have helped me before; and i shall need their help in the \n","days to come; for we have reached rivendell, but the ring is not yet at \n","rest.' \n","\n","'i suppose not,' said frodo. 'but so far my only thought has been to \n","get here; and i hope i shan't have to go any further. it is very pleasant \n","just to rest. i have had a month of exile and adventure, and i find that has \n","been as much as i want.' \n","\n","he fell silent and shut his eyes. after a while he spoke again. 'i have \n","been reckoning,' he said, 'and i can't bring the total up to october the \n","twenty-fourth. it ought to be the twenty-first. we must have reached the \n","ford by the twentieth.' \n","\n","'you have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said gandalf. \n","'how do the side and shoulder feel now?' \n","\n","'i don't know.' frodo answered. 'they don't feel at all: which is an \n","improvement, but'- he made an effort- 'i can move my arm again a little. \n","yes, it is coming back to life. it is not cold,' he added, touching his left \n","hand with his right. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'good!' said gandalf. \"it is mending fast. you will soon be sound \n","again. elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were \n","brought in.' \n","\n","'days?' said frodo. \n","\n","'well, four nights and three days, to be exact. the elves brought you \n","from this where you lost count. we have been terribly anxious, and sam has \n","hardly left your side, day or night, except to run messages. elrond is a \n","master of healing, but the weapons of our enemy are deadly. to tell you the \n","truth, i had very little hope; for i suspected that there was some fragment \n","of the blade still in the closed wound. but it could not be found until last \n","night. then elrond removed a splinter. it was deeply buried, and it was \n","working inwards.' \n","\n","frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that \n","had vanished in strider's hands. 'don't be alarmed!' said gandalf. 'it is \n","gone now. it has been melted. and it seems that hobbits fade very \n","reluctantly. i have known strong warriors of the big people who would \n","quickly have been overcome by that splinter, which you bore for seventeen \n","days.' \n","\n","'what would they have done to me?' asked frodo. 'what were the riders \n","trying to do?' \n","\n","'they tried to pierce your heart with a morgul-knife which remains in \n","the wound. if they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only \n","weaker and under their command. you would have became a wraith under \n","the \n","\n","dominion of the dark lord; and he would have tormented you for trying to \n","keep his ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it \n","and seeing it on his hand.' \n","\n","'thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger!' said frodo \n","faintly. i was mortally afraid, of course; but if i had known more, i should \n","not have dared even to move. it is a marvel that i escaped!' \n","\n","'yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said gandalf, 'not to mention \n","courage. for your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; \n","and that was because you resisted to the last. but it was a terribly narrow \n","shave, so to speak. you were in gravest peril while you wore the ring, for \n","then you were half in the wraith- world yourself, and they might have seized \n","you. you could see them, and they could see you.' \n","\n","'i know,' said frodo. 'they were terrible to behold! but why could we \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","all see their horses?' \n","\n","'because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes \n","that they wear to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings \n","with the living.' \n","\n","'then why do these black horses endure such riders? all other animals \n","are terrified when they draw near, even the elf-horse of glorfindel. the \n","dogs howl and the geese scream at them.' \n","\n","'because these horses are born and bred to the service of the dark lord \n","in mordor. not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! there are ores and \n","trolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and there have been and still are \n","many men, warriors and kings, that walk alive under the sun, and yet are \n","under his sway. and their number is growing daily.' \n","\n","'what about rivendell and the elves? is rivendell safe?' \n","\n","'yes, at present, until all else is conquered. the elves may fear the \n","dark lord, and they may fly before him, but never again will they listen to \n","him or serve him. and here in rivendell there live still some of his chief \n","foes: the elven-wise, lords of the eldar from beyond the furthest seas. they \n","do not fear the ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the blessed realm \n","live at once in both worlds, and against both the seen and the unseen they \n","have great power.' \n","\n","'i thought that i saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim \n","like the others. was that glorfindel then?' \n","\n","'yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the \n","mighty of the firstborn. lie is an elf-lord of a house of princes. indeed \n","there is a power in rivendell to withstand the might of mordor, for a while: \n","and elsewhere other powers still dwell. there is power, too, of another kind \n","in the shire. but all such places will soon become islands under siege, if \n","things go on as they are going. the dark lord is putting forth all his \n","strength. \n","\n","'still,' he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin, while \n","his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire, 'we must keep up our \n","courage. you will soon be well, if i do not talk you to death. you are in \n","rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.' \n","\n","'i haven't any courage to keep up,' said frodo, 'but i am not worried \n","at the moment. just give me news of my friends, and tell me the end of the \n","affair at the ford, as i keep on asking, and i shall be content for the \n","present. after that i shall have another sleep, i think; but i shan't be \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me.' \n","\n","gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at frodo. \n","\n","the colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully \n","awake and aware. he was smiling, and there seemed to be little wrong with \n","him. but to the wizard's eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were \n","of transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay \n","outside upon the coverlet. \n","\n","'still that must be expected,' said gandalf to himself. 'he is not half \n","through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even elrond can \n","foretell. not to evil, i think. he may become like a glass filled with a \n","clear light for eyes to see that can.' \n","\n","'you look splendid,' he said aloud. 'i will risk a brief tale without \n","consulting elrond. but quite brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again. \n","this is what happened, as far as i can gather. the riders made straight for \n","you, as soon as you fled. they did not need the guidance of their horses any \n","longer: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold of \n","their world. and also the ring drew them. your friends sprang aside, off the \n","road, or they would have been ridden down. they knew that nothing could save \n","you, if the white horse could not. the riders were too swift to overtake, \n","and too many to oppose. on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could \n","not with stand all the nine at once. \n","\n","'when the ring wraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind. close to \n","the ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted \n","trees. there they hastily kindled fire; for glorfindel knew that a flood \n","would come down, if the riders tried to cross, and then he would have to \n","deal with any that were left on his side of the river. the moment the flood \n","appeared, he rushed out, followed by aragorn and the. others with flaming \n","brands. caught between fire and water, and seeing an elf-lord revealed in \n","his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with madness. \n","three were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were \n","now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.' \n","\n","'and is that the end of the black riders?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'no,' said gandalf. 'their horses must have perished, and without them \n","they are crippled. but the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily \n","destroyed. however, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. your \n","friends crossed after the flood had passed; and they found you lying on your \n","face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under you. the horse was \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","standing guard beside you. you were pale and cold, and they feared that you \n","were dead, or worse. elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards \n","ri vendell. ' \n","\n","'who made the flood?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'elrond commanded it,' answered gandalf. 'the river of this valley is \n","under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the \n","ford. as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode into the water the \n","flood was released. if i may say so, i added a few touches of my own: you \n","may not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white \n","horses with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding \n","boulders. for a moment i was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a \n","wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away. there is \n","great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the misty \n","mountains.' \n","\n","'yes, it all comes back to me now,' said frodo: 'the tremendous \n","roaring. i thought i was drowning, with my friends and enemies and all. but \n","now we are safe!' \n","\n","gandalf looked quickly at frodo, but he had shut his eyes. 'yes, you \n","are all safe for the present. soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to \n","celebrate the victory at the ford of bruinen, and you will all be there in \n","places of honour.' \n","\n","'splendid!' said frodo. 'it is wonderful that elrond, and glorfindel \n","and such great lords, not to mention strider, should take so much trouble \n","and show me so much kindness.' \n","\n","'well, there are many reasons why they should,' said gandalf, smiling. \n","\n","'i am one good reason. the ring is another: you are the ring-bearer. and you \n","are the heir of bilbo, the ring-finder.' \n","\n","'dear bilbo!' said frodo sleepily. 'i wonder where he is. i wish he was \n","here and could hear all about it. it would have made him laugh, the cow \n","jumped over the moon! and the poor old troll!' with that he fell fast \n","asleep. \n","\n","frodo was now safe in the fast homely house east of the sea. that house \n","was, as bilbo had long ago reported, 'a perfect house, whether you like food \n","or sleep, or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or \n","a pleasant mixture of them all'. merely to be there was a cure for \n","weariness, fear, and sadness. \n","\n","as the evening drew on, frodo woke up again, and he found that he no \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and \n","probably for singing and story-telling afterwards. he got out of bed and \n","discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had \n","been. he found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him \n","excellently. looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner \n","reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked remarkably like the \n","young nephew of bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the shire; \n","but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully. \n","\n","'yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a \n","looking-glass,' he said to his reflection. 'but now for a merry meeting!' \n","\n","he stretched out his arms and whistled a tune. \n","\n","at that moment there was a knock on the door, and sam came in. he ran \n","to frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. he stroked it gently \n","and then he blushed and turned hastily away. \n","\n","'hullo, sam!' said frodo. \n","\n","'it's warm!' said sam. 'meaning your hand, mr. frodo. it has felt so \n","cold through the long nights. but glory and trumpets!' he cried, turning \n","round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor. 'it's fine to see \n","you up and yourself again, sir! gandalf asked me to come and see if you were \n","ready to come down, and i thought he was joking.' \n","\n","'i am ready,' said frodo. 'let's go and look for the rest of the \n","party!' \n","\n","'i can take you to them, sir,' said sam. 'it's a big house this, and \n","very peculiar. always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what you'll \n","find round a corner. and elves, sir! elves here, and elves there! some like \n","kings, terrible and splendid; and some as merry as children. and the music \n","and the singing-not that i have had the time or the heart for much listening \n","since we got here. but i'm getting to know some of the ways of the place.' \n","\n","'i know what you have been doing, sam,' said frodo, taking his arm. \n","'but you shall be merry tonight, and listen to your heart's content. come \n","on, guide me round the corners!' \n","\n","sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a \n","high garden above the steep bank of the river. he found his friends sitting \n","in a porch on the side of the house looking east. shadows had fallen in the \n","valley below, but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far \n","above. the air was warm. the sound of running and falling water was loud, \n","and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","summer still lingered in elrond's gardens. \n","\n","'hurray!' cried pippin, springing up. 'here is our noble cousin! make \n","way for frodo, lord of the ring!' \n","\n","'hush!' said gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch. 'evil \n","things do not come into this valley; but all the same we should not name \n","them. the lord of the ring is not frodo, but the master of the dark tower of \n","mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world! we are sitting \n","in a fortress. outside it is getting dark.' \n","\n","'gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said pippin. \n","\n","'he thinks i need keeping in order. but it seems impossible, somehow, to \n","feel gloomy or depressed in this place. i feel i could sing, if i knew the \n","right song for the occasion.' \n","\n","'i feel like singing myself,' laughed frodo. 'though at the moment i \n","feel more like eating and drinking!' \n","\n","'that will soon be cured,' said pippin. 'you have shown your usual \n","cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.' \n","\n","'more than meal! a feast!' said merry. 'as soon as gandalf reported \n","that you were recovered, the preparations began.' he had hardly finished \n","speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells. \n","\n","the hall of elrond's house was filled with folk: elves for the most \n","part, though there were a few guests of other sorts. elrond, as was his \n","custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and \n","next to him on the one side sat glorfindel, on the other side sat gandalf. \n","\n","frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen elrond, of \n","whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left, \n","glorfindel, and even gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were \n","revealed \n","\n","as lords of dignity and power. gandalf was shorter in stature than the other \n","two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad \n","shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. in his aged \n","face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could \n","leap suddenly into fire. \n","\n","glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his \n","face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and \n","keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was \n","strength. \n","\n","the face of elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. his hair was dark \n","as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his \n","eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of \n","stars. venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale \n","as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. he was the lord of \n","rivendell and mighty among both elves and men. \n","\n","in the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, \n","there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, \n","and so like was she in form of womanhood to elrond that frodo guessed that \n","she was one of his close kindred. young she was and yet not so. the braids \n","of her dark hair were touched by no frost, her white arms and clear face \n","were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, \n","grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge \n","were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years \n","bring. above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted \n","with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament \n","save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. \n","\n","so it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; arwen, \n","daughter of elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of lthien had \n","come on earth again; and she was called undumiel, for she was the evenstar \n","of her people. long she had been in the land of her mother's kin, in lurien \n","beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to rivendell to her \n","father's house. but her brothers, elladan and elrohir, were out upon \n","errantry: for they rode often far afield with the rangers of the north, \n","forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the ores. \n","\n","such loveliness in living thing frodo had never seen before nor \n","imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he \n","had a seat at elrond' s table among all these folk so high and fair. though \n","he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several cushions, he felt very \n","small, and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed. the feast \n","was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire. it was some time \n","before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours. \n","\n","he looked first for his friends. sam had begged to be allowed to wait \n","on his master, but had been told that for this time he was a guest of \n","honour. frodo could see him now, sitting with pippin and merry at the upper \n","end of one of the side-tables close to the dais. he could see no sign of \n","strider. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly \n","dressed. his beard, very long and forked, was white, nearly as white as the \n","snow-white cloth of his garments. he wore a silver belt, and round his neck \n","hung a chain of silver and diamonds. frodo stopped eating to look at him. \n","\n","'welcome and well met!' said the dwarf, turning towards him. then he \n","actually rose from his seat and bowed. 'gluin at your service,' he said, and \n","bowed still lower. \n","\n","'frodo baggins at your service and your family's,' said frodo \n","correctly, rising in surprise and scattering his cushions. 'am i right in \n","guessing that you are the gluin, one of the twelve companions of the great \n","thorin oaken shield?' \n","\n","'quite right,' answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and \n","courteously assisting frodo back into his seat. 'and i do not ask, for i \n","have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our \n","friend bilbo the renowned. allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.' \n","\n","'thank you very much,' said frodo. \n","\n","'you have had some very strange adventures, i hear,' said gluin. 'i \n","wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey. nothing like \n","it has happened since bilbo came with us. but perhaps i should not inquire \n","too closely, since elrond and gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?' \n","\n","'i think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,' said frodo \n","politely. \n","\n","he guessed that even in elrond's house the matter of the ring was not \n","one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a \n","time. 'but i am equally curious,' he added, 'to learn what brings so \n","important a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain.' \n","\n","gluin looked at him. 'if you have not heard, i think we will not speak \n","yet of that either. master elrond will summon us all ere long, i believe, \n","and then we shall all hear many things. but there is much else that may be \n","told.' \n","\n","throughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but frodo \n","listened more than he spoke; for the news of the shire, apart from the ring, \n","seemed small and far-away and unimportant, while gluin had much to tell of \n","events in the northern regions of wilderland. frodo learned that grimbeorn \n","the old, son of beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men, and to their \n","land between the mountains and mirkwood neither ore nor wolf dared to go. \n","\n","'indeed,' said gluin, 'if it were not for the beornings, the passage \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","from dale to rivendell would long ago have become impossible. they are \n","valiant men and keep open the high pass and the ford of carrock. but their \n","tolls are high,' he added with a shake of his head; 'and like beorn of old \n","they are not over fond of dwarves. still, they are trusty, and that is much \n","in these days. nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the men of \n","dale. they are good folk, the bardings. the grandson of bard the bowman \n","rules them, brand son of bain son of bard. he is a strong king, and his \n","realm now reaches far south and east of esgaroth.' \n","\n","'and what of your own people?' asked frodo. \n","\n","'there is much to tell, good and bad,' said gluin; 'yet it is mostly \n","good: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not escape the shadow of \n","these times. if you really wish to hear of us, i will tell you tidings \n","gladly. but stop me when you are weary! dwarves' tongues run on when \n","speaking of their handiwork, they say.' \n","\n","and with that gluin embarked on a long account of the doings of the \n","dwarf-kingdom. he was delighted to have found so polite a listener; for \n","frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, \n","though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people \n","and places that he had never heard of before. he was interested, however, to \n","hear that dbin was still king under the mountain, and was now old (having \n","passed his two hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich. \n","\n","of the ten companions who had survived the battle of five armies seven were \n","still with him: dwalin, gluin, dori, nori, bifur, bofur, and bombur. bombur \n","was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at \n","table, and it took six young dwarves to lift him. \n","\n","'and what has become of balin and ori and uin?' asked frodo. \n","\n","a shadow passed over gluin's face. 'we do not know,' he answered. 'it \n","is largely on account of balin that i have come to ask the advice of those \n","that dwell in rivendell. but tonight let us speak of merrier things!' \n","\n","gluin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling frodo \n","about their great labours in dale and under the mountain. 'we have done \n","well,' he said. 'but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers, many of \n","whose, secrets are lost. we make good armour and keen swords, but we cannot \n","again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon \n","came. only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days. you should \n","see the waterways of dale, frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! you \n","should see the stone-paved roads of many colours! and the halls and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the \n","terraces and towers upon the mountain's sides! then you would see that we \n","have not been idle.' \n","\n","'i will come and see them, if ever i can,' said frodo. 'how surprised \n","bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the desolation of smaug!' \n","\n","gluin looked at frodo and smiled. 'you were very fond of bilbo were you \n","not?' he asked. \n","\n","'yes,' answered frodo. 1 would rather see him than all the towers and \n","palaces in the world.' \n","\n","at length the feast came to an end. elrond and arwen rose and went down \n","the hall, and the company followed them in due order. the doors were thrown \n","open, and they went across a wide passage and through other doors, and came \n","into a further hall. in it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in \n","a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side. \n","\n","frodo found himself walking with gandalf. 'this is the hall of fire' \n","said the wizard. 'here you will hear many songs and tales-if you can keep \n","awake. but except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people \n","come here who wish for peace, and thought. there is always a fire here, all \n","the year round, but there is little other light.' \n","\n","as elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, elvish \n","minstrels began to make sweet music. slowly the hall filled, and frodo \n","looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together; \n","the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair. suddenly \n","he noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure \n","seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. beside him on the \n","ground was a drinking-cup and some bread. frodo wondered whether he was \n","ill \n","\n","(if people were ever ill in ri vendell), and had been unable to come to the \n","feast. his head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark \n","cloak was drawn over his face. \n","\n","elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure. 'awake little \n","master, he said, with a smile. then, turning to frodo, he beckoned to him. \n","'now at last the hour has come that you have wished for, frodo,' he said. \n","'here is a friend that you have long missed.' \n","\n","the dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face. \n","\n","'bilbo!' cried frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward. \n","\n","'hullo, frodo my lad!' said bilbo. 'so you have got here at last. i \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","hoped you would manage it. well, well! so all this feasting is in your \n","honour, i hear. i hope you enjoyed yourself?' \n","\n","'why weren't you there?' cried frodo. 'and why haven't i been allowed \n","to see you before?' \n","\n","'because you were asleep. i have seen a good deal of you. i have sat by \n","your side with sam each day. but as for the feast' i don't go in for such \n","things much now. and i had something else to do.' \n","\n","'what were you doing?' \n","\n","'why, sitting and thinking. i do a lot of that nowadays, and this is \n","the best place to do it in, as a rule. wake up, indeed!' he said, cocking an \n","eye at elrond. there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness \n","that frodo could see. 'wake up! i was not asleep. master elrond. if you want \n","to know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, and you have \n","disturbed me-in the middle of making up a song. i was stuck over a line or \n","two, and was thinking about them; but now i don't suppose i shall ever get \n","them right. there will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be \n","driven clean out of my head. i shall have to get my friend the dnadan to \n","help me. where is he?' \n","\n","elrond laughed. 'he shall be found,' he said. 'then you two shall go \n","into a corner and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before \n","we end our merrymaking.' messengers were sent to find bilbo's friend, though \n","none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast. \n","\n","in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side, and sam came quickly \n","and placed himself near them. they talked together in soft voices, oblivious \n","of the mirth and music in the hall about them. bilbo had not much to say of \n","himself. when he had left hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the \n","road or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all the \n","time towards ri vendell. 'i got here without much adventure,' he said, 'and \n","after a rest i went on with the dwarves to dale: my last journey. i shan't \n","travel again. old balin had gone away. then i came back here, and here i \n","have been. i have done this and that. i have written some more of my book. \n","and, of course, i make up a few songs. they sing them occasionally: just to \n","please me, i think; for, of course, they aren't really good enough for \n","rivendell. and i listen and i think. time doesn't seem to pass here: it just \n","is. a remarkable place altogether. \n","\n","'i hear all kinds of news, from over the mountains, and out of the \n","south, but hardly anything from the shire. i heard about the ring, of \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","course. gandalf has been here often. not that he has told me a great deal, \n","he has become closer than ever these last few years. the dnadan has told me \n","more. fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! it is a pity that \n","gandalf did not find out more sooner. i could have brought the thing here \n","myself long ago without so much trouble. i have thought several times of \n","going back to hobbiton for it; but i am getting old, and they would not let \n","me: gandalf and elrond, i mean. they seemed to think that the enemy was \n","looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught \n","me \n","\n","tottering about in the wild. \n","\n","'and gandalf said: \"the ring has passed on, bilbo. it would do no good \n","to you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it again.\" odd sort of \n","remark, just like gandalf. but he said he was looking after you, so i let \n","things be. i am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound.' he paused and \n","looked at frodo doubtfully. \n","\n","'have you got it here?' he asked in a whisper. i can't help feeling \n","curious, you know, after all i've heard. i should very much like just to \n","peep at it again.' \n","\n","'yes, i've got it,' answered frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. 'it \n","looks just the same as ever it did.' \n","\n","'well, i should just like to see it for a moment,' said bilbo. \n","\n","when he had dressed, frodo found that while he slept the ring had been \n","hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. slowly he drew it out. \n","bilbo put out his hand. but frodo quickly drew back the ring. to his \n","distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at bilbo; a \n","shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself \n","eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. \n","he felt a desire to strike him. \n","\n","the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell. \n","bilbo looked quickly at frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes. 'i \n","understand now,' he said. 'put it away! i am sorry: sorry you have come in \n","for this burden: sorry about everything. don't adventures ever have an end? \n","\n","i suppose not. someone else always has to carry on the story. well, it can't \n","be helped. i wonder if it's any good trying to finish my book? but don't \n","let's worry about it now-let's have some real news! tell me all about the \n","shire!' \n","\n","frodo hid the ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","of memory. the light and music of rivendell was about him again. bilbo \n","smiled and laughed happily. every item of news from the shire that frodo \n","could tell-aided and corrected now and again by sam-was of the greatest \n","interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the \n","smallest child in hobbiton. they were so deep in the doings of the four \n","farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green \n","cloth. for many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile. \n","\n","suddenly bilbo looked up. 'ah, there you are at last, dnadan!' he \n","cried. \n","\n","'strider!' said frodo. 'you seem to have a lot of names.' \n","\n","'well, strider is one that i haven't heard before, anyway,' said bilbo. \n","\n","'what do you call him that for?' \n","\n","'they call me that in bree,' said strider laughing, 'and that is how i \n","was introduced to him.' \n","\n","'and why do you call him dnadan?' asked frodo. \n","\n","' the dnadan,' said bilbo. 'fie is often called that here. but i thought \n","you knew enough elvish at least to know dn-udan: man of the west, \n","nmenorean. but this is not the time for lessons!' he turned to strider. \n","\n","'where have you been, my friend? why weren't you at the feast? the fady \n","arwen was there.' \n","\n","strider looked down at bilbo gravely. 'i know,' he said. 'but often i \n","must put mirth aside. elladan and elrohir have returned out of the wild \n","unlooked-for, and they had tidings that i wished to hear at once.' \n","\n","'well, my dear fellow,' said bilbo, 'now you've heard the news, can't \n","you spare me a moment? i want your help in something urgent. elrond says \n","this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening, and i am \n","stuck. fet's go off into a corner and polish it up!' \n","\n","strider smiled. 'come then!' he said. 'fet me hear it!' \n","\n","frodo was left to himself for a while, for sam had fallen asleep. he \n","was alone and felt rather forlorn' although all about him the folk of \n","rivendell were gathered. but those near him were silent, intent upon the \n","music of the voices and the instruments, and they gave no heed to anything \n","else. frodo began to listen. \n","\n","at first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in \n","elven-tongues, even though he understood them little' held him in a spell, \n","as soon as he began to attend to them. almost it seemed that the words took \n","shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden \n","mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. then the \n","enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless \n","river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous \n","for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air \n","about him, and it drenched and drowned him. swiftly he sank under its \n","shining weight into a deep realm of sleep. \n","\n","there he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running \n","water, and then suddenly into a voice. it seemed to be the voice of bilbo \n","chanting verses. faint at first and then clearer ran the words. \n","\n","edrendil was a mariner \n","that tarried in arvernien; \n","he built a boat of timber felled \n","in nimbrethil to journey in; \n","her sails he wove of silver fair, \n","of silver were her lanterns made, \n","her prow was fashioned like a swan, \n","and light upon her banners laid. \n","\n","in panoply of ancient kings, \n","in chain, d rings he armoured him; \n","his shining shield was scored with runes \n","to ward all wounds and harm from him; \n","his bow was made of dragon-horn, \n","his arrows shorn of ebony, \n","of silver was his habergeon, \n","his scabbard of chalcedony; \n","his sword of steel was valiant, \n","of adamant his helmet tall, \n","an eagle-plume upon his crest, \n","upon his breast an emerald. \n","\n","beneath the moon and under star \n","he wandered far from northern strands, \n","bewildered on enchanted ways \n","beyond the days of mortal lands. \n","\n","from gnashing of the narrow ice \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","where shadow lies on frozen hills, \n","from nether heats and burning waste \n","he turned in haste, and roving still \n","on starless waters far astray \n","at last he came to night of naught, \n","and passed, and never sight he saw \n","of shining shore nor light he sought. \n","\n","the winds of wrath came driving him, \n","and blindly in the foam he fled \n","from west to east and errandless, \n","unheralded he homeward sped. \n","\n","there flying elwing came to him, \n","and flame was in the darkness lit; \n","more bright than light of diamond \n","the fire upon her carcanet. \n","\n","the silmaril she bound on him \n","and crowned him with the living light \n","and dauntless then with burning brow \n","he turned his prow; and in the night \n","from otherworld beyond the sea \n","there strong and free a storm arose, \n","a wind of power in tarmenel; \n","by paths that seldom mortal goes \n","his boat it bore with biting breath \n","as might of death across the grey \n","and long-forsaken seas distressed: \n","from east to west he passed away. \n","\n","through evernight he back was borne \n","on black and roaring waves that ran \n","o'er leagues unlit and foundered shores \n","that drowned before the days began, \n","until he heard on strands of pearl \n","when ends the world the music long, \n","where ever foaming billows roll \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the yellow gold and jewels wan. \n","\n","he saw the mountain silent rise \n","where twilight lies upon the knees \n","of valinor, and eldamar \n","beheld afar beyond the seas. \n","\n","a wanderer escaped from night \n","to haven white he came at last, \n","to elvenhome the green and fair \n","where keen the air, where pale as glass \n","beneath the hill of ilmarin \n","a-glimmer in a valley sheer \n","the lamplit towers oftirion \n","are mirrored on the shadowmere. \n","\n","he tarried there from errantry, \n","and melodies they taught to him, \n","and sages old him marvels told, \n","and harps of gold they brought to him. \n","they clothed him then in elven-white, \n","and seven lights before him sent, \n","as through the calacirian \n","to hidden land forlorn he went. \n","\n","he came unto the timeless halls \n","where shining fall the countless years, \n","and endless reigns the elder king \n","in ilmarin on mountain sheer; \n","and words unheard were spoken then \n","of folk of men and elven-kin, \n","beyond the world were visions showed \n","forbid to those that dwell therein. \n","\n","a ship then new they built for him \n","of mithril and of elven-glass \n","with shining prow; no shaven oar \n","nor sail she bore on silver mast: \n","the silmaril as lantern light \n","and banner bright with living flame \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","to gleam thereon by elbereth \n","herself was set, who thither came \n","and wings immortal made for him, \n","and laid on him undying doom, \n","to sail the shoreless skies and come \n","behind the sun and light of moon. \n","\n","from evereven's lofty hills \n","where softly silver fountains fall \n","his wings him bore, a wandering light, \n","beyond the mighty mountain wall. \n","\n","from world's end then he turned away \n","and yearned again to find afar \n","his home through shadows journeying, \n","and burning as an island star \n","on high above the mists he came, \n","a distant flame before the sun, \n","a wonder ere the waking dawn \n","where grey the norland waters run. \n","\n","and over middle-earth he passed \n","and heard at last the weeping sore \n","of women and of elven-maids \n","in elder days, in years of yore, \n","gut on him mighty doom was laid, \n","till moon should fade, an orb,d star \n","to pass, and tarry never more \n","on hither shores where mortals are; \n","for ever still a herald on \n","an errand that should never rest \n","to bear his shining lamp afar, \n","the flammifer of westernesse. \n","\n","the chanting ceased. frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was \n","seated on his stool in a circle of listeners, who were smiling and \n","applauding. \n","\n","'now we had better have it again,' said an elf. \n","\n","bilbo got up and bowed. 'i am flattered, lindir,' he said. 'but it \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","would be too tiring to repeat it all.' \n","\n","'not too tiring for you,' the elves answered laughing. 'you know you \n","are never tired of reciting your own verses. but really we cannot answer \n","your question at one hearing!' \n","\n","'what!' cried bilbo. 'you can't tell which parts were mine, and which \n","were the dnadan's?' \n","\n","'it is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals' said \n","the elf. \n","\n","'nonsense, lindir,' snorted bilbo. 'if you can't distinguish between a \n","man and a hobbit, your judgement is poorer than i imagined. they're as \n","different as peas and apples.' \n","\n","'maybe. to sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,' laughed \n","lindir. 'or to shepherds. but mortals have not been our study. we have other \n","business.' \n","\n","'i won't argue with you,' said bilbo. 'i am sleepy after so much music \n","and singing. i'll leave you to guess, if you want to.' \n","\n","he got up and came towards frodo. 'well, that's over,' he said in a low \n","voice. 'it went off better than i expected. i don't often get asked for a \n","second hearing. what did you think of it?' \n","\n","'i am not going to try and guess,' said frodo smiling. \n","\n","'you needn't,' said bilbo. 'as a matter of fact it was all mine. except \n","that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone. he seemed to think it \n","important. i don't know why. otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing \n","rather above my head, and he said that if i had the cheek to make verses \n","about edrendil in the house of elrond, it was my affair. i suppose he was \n","right.' \n","\n","'i don't know,' said frodo. 'it seemed to me to fit somehow, though i \n","can't explain. i was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on \n","from something that i was dreaming about. i didn't understand that it was \n","really you speaking until near the end.' \n","\n","'it is difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it;' said \n","bilbo. 'not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for \n","music and poetry and tales. they seem to like them as much as food, or more. \n","they will be going on for a long time yet. what do you say to slipping off \n","for some more quiet talk?' \n","\n","'can we?' said frodo. \n","\n","'of course. this is merrymaking not business. come and go as you like, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","as long as you don't make a noise.' \n","\n","they got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the \n","doors. sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. in \n","spite of his delight in bilbo's company frodo felt a tug of regret as they \n","passed out of the hall of fire. even as they stepped over the threshold a \n","single clear voice rose in song. \n","\n","a elbereth gilthoniel, \n","silivren penna mnriel \n","o menel aglar elenath! \n","\n","na-chaered palan-dnriel \n","o galadhremmin ennorath, \n","\n","fanuilos, le linnathon \n","nef aear, sn nef aearon! \n","\n","frodo halted for a moment, looking back. elrond was in his chair and \n","the fire was on his face like summer -light upon the trees. near him sat the \n","lady arwen. to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her; his \n","dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a \n","star shone on his breast. they spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed \n","to frodo that arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on \n","him from afar and pierced his heart. \n","\n","he stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song \n","fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. ' it is a song to \n","elbereth,' said bilbo. 'they will sing that, and other songs of the blessed \n","realm, many times tonight. come on!' \n","\n","he led frodo back to his own little room. it opened on to the gar dens \n","and looked south across the ravine of the bruinen. there they sat for some \n","while, looking through the window at the bright stars above the \n","steep-climbing woods, and talking softly. they spoke no more of the small \n","news of the shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that \n","encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen in the world \n","together, of the elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the \n","bright year in the woods. \n","\n","at last there came a knock on the door. 'begging your pardon,' said \n","sam, putting in his head, 'but i was just wondering if you would be wanting \n","anything.' \n","\n","'and begging yours, sam gamgee,' replied bilbo. 'i guess you mean that \n","it is time your master went to bed.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'well, sir, there is a council early tomorrow, i hear and he only got \n","up today for the first time.' \n","\n","'quite right, sam,' laughed bilbo. 'you can trot off and tell gandalf \n","that he has gone to bed. good night, frodo! bless me, but it has been good \n","to see you again! there are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good \n","talk. i am getting very old, and i began to wonder if i should ever live to \n","see your chapters of our story. good night! i'll take a walk, i think, and \n","look at the stars of elbereth in the garden. sleep well!' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 2 . the council of elrond \n","\n","\n","\n","next day frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. he walked along \n","the terraces above the loud-flowing bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun \n","rise above the far mountains, and shine down. slanting through the thin \n","silver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering, and the woven \n","nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. sam walked beside him, saying \n","nothing, but sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder \n","in his eyes at the great heights in the east. the snow was white upon their \n","peaks. \n","\n","on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon \n","gandalf and bilbo deep in talk. 'hullo! good morning!' said bilbo. 'feel \n","ready for the great council?' \n","\n","'i feel ready for anything,' answered frodo. 'but most of all i should \n","like to go walking today and explore the valley. i should like to get into \n","those pine- woods up there.' he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to \n","the north. \n","\n","'you may have a chance later,' said gandalf. 'but we cannot make any \n","plans yet. there is much to hear and decide today.' \n","\n","suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. 'that is \n","the warning bell for the council of elrond,' cried gandalf. 'come along now! \n","both you and bilbo are wanted.' \n","\n","frodo and bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back \n","to the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten, trotted \n","sam. \n","\n","gandalf led them to the porch where frodo had found his friends the \n","evening before. the light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the \n","valley. the noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river-bed. \n","birds were singing, and a wholesome peace lay on the land. to frodo his \n","dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world \n","outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces \n","that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave. \n","\n","elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him. \n","frodo saw glorfindel and gluin; and in a corner alone strider was sitting, \n","clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. elrond drew frodo to a seat by \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","his side, and presented him to the company, saying: \n","\n","'here, my friends is the hobbit, frodo son of drogo. few have ever come \n","hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.' \n","\n","he then pointed out and named those whom frodo had not met before. \n","there was a younger dwarf at gluin's side: his son gimli. beside glorfindel \n","there were several other counsellors of elrond's household, of whom erestor \n","was the chief; and with him was galdor, an elf from the grey havens who had \n","come on an errand from cnrdan the shipwright. there was also a strange elf \n","clad in green and brown, legolas, a messenger from his father, thranduil, \n","the king of the elves of northern mirkwood. and seated a little apart was a \n","tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and \n","stern of glance. \n","\n","he was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed \n","though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were \n","stained with long travel. he had a collar of silver in which a single white \n","stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. on a baldric he \n","wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. he \n","gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonder. \n","\n","'here,' said elrond, turning to gandalf, 'is boromir, a man from the \n","south. he arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. i have bidden \n","him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.' \n","\n","not all that was spoken and debated in the council need now be told. \n","much was said of events in the world outside, especially in the south, and \n","in the wide lands east of the mountains. of these things frodo had already \n","heard many rumours; but the tale of gluin was new to him, and when the dwarf \n","spoke he listened attentively. it appeared that amid the splendour of their \n","works of hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were \n","troubled. \n","\n","'it is now many years ago,' said gluin, 'that a shadow of disquiet fell \n","upon our people. whence it came we did not at first perceive. words began to \n","be whispered in secret-: it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, \n","and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. some \n","spoke of moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own \n","tongue khazad-dym; and they declared that now at last we had the power and \n","numbers to return.' \n","\n","gluin sighed. 'moria! moria! wonder of the northern world! too deep we \n","delved there, and woke the nameless fear. long have its vast mansions lain \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","empty since the children of durin fled. but now we spoke of it again with \n","longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of \n","khazad-dym for many lives of kings, save thrur only, and he perished. at \n","last, however, balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and \n","though dbin did not give leave willingly, he took with him ori and uin and \n","many of our folk, and they went away south. \n","\n","\"that was nigh on thirty years ago. for a while we had news and it \n","seemed good: messages reported that moria had been entered and a great work \n","begun there. then there was silence, and no word has ever come from moria \n","since. \n","\n","\"then about a year ago a messenger came to dbin, but not from \n","moria -from mordor: a horseman in the night, who called dbin to his gate. the \n","lord sauron the great, so he said, wished for our friendship. rings he would \n","give for it, such as he gave of old. and he asked urgently concerning \n","hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. \"for sauron knows,\" \n","said he, \"that one of these was known to you on a time.\" \n","\n","'at this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. and then his \n","fell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if he could. \"as a \n","small token only of your friendship sauron asks this,\" he said: \"that you \n","should find this thief,\" such was his word, \"and get from him, willing or \n","no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. it is but a \n","trifle that sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. find it, and \n","three rings that the dwarf sires possessed of old shall be returned to you, \n","and the realm of moria shall be yours for ever. find only news of the thief, \n","whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and \n","lasting friendship from the lord. refuse, and things will not seem so well. \n","\n","do you refuse?\" \n","\n","'at that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by \n","shuddered, but dbin said: \"i say neither yea nor nay. i must consider this \n","message and what it means under its fair cloak.\" \n","\n","' \"consider well, but not too long,\" said he. \n","\n","\" \"the time of my thought is my own to spend,\" answered dbin. \n","\n","' \"for the present,\" said he, and rode into the darkness. \n","\n","'heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. we \n","needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held \n","both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power that has \n","re-entered mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. twice the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. the third and last time, so \n","he says, is soon to come, before the ending of the year. \n","\n","'and so i have been sent at last by dbin to warn bilbo that he is \n","sought by the enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this \n","least of rings. also we crave the advice of elrond. for the shadow grows and \n","draws nearer. we discover that messengers have come also to king brand in \n","dale, and that he is afraid. we fear that he may yield. already war is \n","gathering on his eastern borders. if we make no answer, the enemy may move \n","men of his rule to assail king brand, and dbin also.' \n","\n","'you have done well to come,' said elrond. 'you will hear today all \n","that you need in order to understand the purposes of the enemy. there is \n","naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without it. but \n","you do not stand alone. you will learn that your trouble is but part of the \n","trouble of all the western world. the ring ! what shall we do with the ring, \n","the least of rings, the trifle that sauron fancies? that is the doom that we \n","must deem. \n","\n","'that is the purpose for which you are called hither. called, i say. \n","though i have not called you to me, strangers from distant lands. you have \n","come and are here met, in this very nick of time, by chance as it may seem. \n","\n","yet it is not so. believe rather that it is so ordered that we, who sit \n","here, and none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world. \n","\n","'now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden \n","from all but a few until this day. and first, so that all may understand \n","what is the peril, the tale of the ring shall be told from the beginning \n","even to this present. and i will begin that tale, though others shall end \n","it.' \n","\n","then all listened while elrond in his clear voice spoke of sauron and \n","the rings of power, and their forging in the second age of the world long \n","ago. a part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none, \n","and many eyes were turned t= elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the \n","elven-smiths of eregion and their friendship with moria, and their eagerness \n","for knowledge, by which sauron ensnared them. for in that time he was not \n","yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft, \n","whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly \n","in the mountain of fire the one ring to be their master. but celebrimbor was \n","aware of him, and hid the three which he had made; and there was war, and \n","the land was laid waste, and the gate of moria was shut. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","then through all the years that followed he traced the ring; but since \n","that history is elsewhere recounted, even as elrond himself set it down in \n","his books of lore, it is not here recalled. for it is a long tale, full of \n","deeds great and terrible, and briefly though elrond spoke, the sun rode up \n","the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased. \n","\n","of nmenor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the \n","kings of men to middle-earth out of the deeps of the sea, borne upon the \n","wings of storm. then elendil the tall and his mighty sons, isildur and \n","anbrion, became great lords; and the north-realm they made in arnor, and the \n","south-realm in gondor above the mouths of anduin. but sauron of mordor \n","assailed them, and they made the last alliance of elves and men, and the \n","hosts of gil-galad and elendil were mustered in arnor. \n","\n","thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed. 'i remember well the \n","splendour of their banners,' he said. v it recalled to me the glory of the \n","elder days and the hosts of beleriand, so many great princes and captains \n","were assembled. and yet not so many, nor so fair, as when thangorodrim was \n","broken, and the elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not \n","so.' \n","\n","'you remember?' said frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his \n","astonishment. 'but i thought,' he stammered as elrond turned towards him, 'i \n","thought that the fall of gil-galad was a long age ago.' \n","\n","'so it was indeed,' answered elrond gravely. 'but my memory reaches \n","back even to the elder days. edrendil was my sire, who was born in gondolin \n","before its fall; and my mother was elwing, daughter of dior, son of lthien \n","of doriath. i have seen three ages in the west of the world, and many \n","defeats, and many fruitless victories. \n","\n","'i was the herald of gil-galad and marched with his host. i was at the \n","battle of dagorlad before the black gate of mordor, where we had the \n","mastery: for the spear of gil-galad and the sword of elendil, aiglos and \n","narsil, none could withstand. i beheld the last combat on the slopes of \n","orodruin, where gil-galad died, and elendil fell, and narsil broke beneath \n","him; but sauron himself was overthrown, and isildur cut the ring from his \n","hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword, and took it for his own.' \n","\n","at this the stranger, boromir, broke in. 'so that is what became of the \n","ring!' he cried. 'if ever such a tale was told in the south, it has long \n","been forgotten. i have heard of the great ring of him that we do not name; \n","but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","realm. isildur took it! that is tidings indeed.' \n","\n","'alas! yes,' said elrond. 'isildur took it, as should not have been. it \n","should have been cast then into orodruin's fire nigh at hand where it was \n","made. but few marked what isildur did. he alone stood by his father in that \n","last mortal contest; and by gil-galad only cnrdan stood, and i. but isildur \n","would not listen to our counsel. \n","\n","' \"this i will have as weregild for my father, and my brother,\" he \n","said; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it. but \n","soon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named in the north \n","isildur's bane. yet death maybe was better than what else might have \n","befallen him. \n","\n","'only to the north did these tidings come, and only to a few. small \n","wonder it is that you have not heard them, boromir. from the ruin of the \n","gladden fields, where isildur perished, three men only came ever back over \n","the mountains after long wandering. one of these was ohtar, the esquire of \n","isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of elendil; and he brought them to \n","valandil, the heir of isildur, who being but a child had remained here in \n","rivendell. but narsil was broken and its light extinguished, and it has not \n","yet been forged again. \n","\n","'fruitless did i call the victory of the fast alliance? not wholly so, \n","yet it did not achieve its end. sauron was diminished, but not destroyed. \n","\n","his ring was lost but not unmade. the dark tower was broken, but its \n","foundations were not removed; for they were made with the power of the ring, \n","and while it remains they will endure. many elves and many mighty men, \n","and \n","\n","many of their friends, had perished in the war. anbrion was slain, and \n","isildur was slain; and gil-galad and elendil were no more. never again shall \n","there be any such league of elves and men; for men multiply and the \n","firstborn decrease, and the two kindreds are estranged. and ever since that \n","day the race of nmenor has decayed, and the span of their years has \n","lessened. \n","\n","'in the north after the war and the slaughter of the gladden fields the \n","men of westernesse were diminished, and their city of annminas beside \n","fake \n","\n","evendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of valandil removed and dwelt at \n","fornost on the high north downs, and that now too is desolate. men call it \n","deadmen's dike, and they fear to tread there. for the folk of arnor \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","dwindled, and their foes devoured them, and their lordship passed, leaving \n","only green mounds in the grassy hills. \n","\n","'in the south the realm of gondor long endured; and for a while its \n","splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of nmenor, ere it fell. \n","high towers that people built, and strong places, and havens of many ships; \n","and the winged crown of the kings of men was held in awe by folk of many \n","tongues. their chief city was osgiliath, citadel of the stars, through the \n","midst of which the river flowed. and minas ithil they built, tower of the \n","rising moon, eastward upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow; and \n","westward at the feet of the white mountains minas anor they made, tower of \n","the setting sun. there in the courts of the king grew a white tree, from the \n","seed of that tree which isildur brought over the deep waters, and the seed \n","of that tree before came from eressla, and before that out of the uttermost \n","west in the day before days when the world was young. \n","\n","'but in the wearing of the swift years of middle-earth the line of \n","meneldil son of anbrion failed, and the tree withered, and the blood of the \n","nmenoreans became mingled with that of lesser men. then the watch upon \n","the \n","\n","walls of mordor slept, and dark things crept back to gorgoroth. and on a \n","time evil things came forth, and they took minas ithil and abode in it, and \n","they made it into a place of dread; and it is called minas morgul, the tower \n","of sorcery. then minas anor was named anew minas tirith, the tower of \n","guard; \n","\n","and these two cities were ever at war, but osgiliath which lay between was \n","deserted and in its ruins shadows walked. \n","\n","'so it has been for many lives of men. but the lords of minas tirith \n","still fight on, defying our enemies, keeping the passage of the river from \n","argonath to the sea. and now that part of the tale that i shall tell is \n","drawn to its close. for in the days of isildur the ruling ring passed out of \n","all knowledge, and the three were released from its dominion. but now in \n","this latter day they are in peril once more, for to our sorrow the one has \n","been found. others shall speak of its finding, for in that i played small \n","part.' \n","\n","he ceased, but at once boromir stood up, tall and proud, before them. \n","\n","give me leave, master elrond, said he, first to say more of gondor; for \n","verily from the land of gondor i am come. and it would be well for all to \n","know what passes there. for few, i deem, know of our deeds, and therefore \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","guess little of their peril, if we should fail at last. \n","\n","'believe not that in the land of gondor the blood of nmenor is spent, \n","nor all its pride and dignity forgotten. by our valour the wild folk of the \n","east are still restrained, and the terror of morgul kept at bay; and thus \n","alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind us, bulwark of \n","the west. but if the passages of the river should be won, what then? \n","\n","'yet that hour, maybe, is not now far away. the nameless enemy has \n","arisen again. smoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount \n","doom. \n","\n","the power of the black land grows and we are hard beset. when the \n","enemy \n","\n","returned our folk were driven from ithilien, our fair domain east of the \n","river, though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms. but this very \n","year, in the days of june, sudden war came upon us out of mordor, and we \n","were swept away. we were outnumbered, for mordor has allied itself with the \n","easterlings and the cruel elaradrim; but it was not by numbers that we were \n","defeated. a power was there that we have not felt before. \n","\n","'some said that it could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark \n","shadow under the moon. wherever he came a madness filled our foes, but fear \n","fell on our boldest, so that horse and man gave way and fled. only a remnant \n","of our eastern force came back, destroying the last bridge that still stood \n","amid the ruins of osgiliath. \n","\n","'i was in the company that held the bridge, until it was cast down \n","behind us. four only were saved by swimming: my brother and myself and \n","two \n","\n","others. but still we fight on, holding all the west shores of anduin; and \n","those who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much \n","praise but little help. only from rohan now will any men ride to us when we \n","call. \n","\n","'in this evil hour i have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues \n","to elrond: a hundred and ten days i have journeyed all alone. but i do not \n","seek allies in war. the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons, it is \n","said. i come to ask for counsel and the unravelling of hard words. for on \n","the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled \n","sleep; and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again, and once to me. \n","\n","'in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a \n","growing thunder, but in the west a pale light lingered, and out of it i \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","heard a voice, remote but clear, crying: \n","\n","seek for the sword that was broken: \n","\n","in imladris it dwells; \n","\n","there shall be counsels taken \n","stronger than morgul-spells. \n","\n","there shall be shown a token \n","that doom is near at hand, \n","\n","for isildur's bane shall waken, \n","\n","and the halfling forth shall stand. \n","\n","of these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our father, \n","denethor, lord of minas tirith, wise in the lore of gondor. this only would \n","he say, that imladris was of old the name among the elves of a far northern \n","dale, where elrond the halfelven dwelt, greatest of lore-masters. therefore \n","my brother, seeing how desperate was our need, was eager to heed the dream \n","and seek for imladris; but since the way was full of doubt and danger, i \n","took the journey upon myself. loth was my father to give me leave, and long \n","have i wandered by roads forgotten, seeking the house of elrond, of which \n","many had heard, but few knew where it lay.' \n","\n","'and here in the house of elrond more shall be made clear to you' said \n","aragorn, standing up. he cast his sword upon the table that stood before \n","elrond, and the blade was in two pieces. 'here is the sword that was \n","broken!' he said. \n","\n","'and who are you, and what have you to do with minas tirith?' asked \n","boromir, looking in wonder at the lean face of the ranger and his \n","weather-stained cloak. \n","\n","'he is aragorn son of arathorn,' said elrond; 'and he is descended \n","through many fathers from isildur elendil's son of minas ithil. he is the \n","chief of the dnedain in the north, and few are now left of that folk.' \n","\n","'then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' cried frodo in \n","amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the ring to be demanded \n","at once. \n","\n","'it does not belong to either of us,' said aragorn; 'but it has been \n","ordained that you should hold it for a while.' \n","\n","'bring out the ring, frodo!' said gandalf solemnly. 'the time has come. \n","hold it up, and then boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.' \n","\n","there was a hush, and all turned their eyes on frodo. he was shaken by \n","a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the ring, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and a loathing of its touch. he wished he was far away. the ring gleamed and \n","flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand. \n","\n","'behold isildur's bane!' said elrond. \n","\n","boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. 'the halfling!' \n","he muttered. 'is then the doom of minas tirith come at last? but why then \n","should we seek a broken sword?' \n","\n","'the words were not the doom of minas tirith ,' said aragorn. 'but doom \n","and great deeds are indeed at hand. for the sword that was broken is the \n","sword of elendil that broke beneath him when he fell. it has been treasured \n","by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for it was spoken of old \n","among us that it should be made again when the ring, isildur's bane, was \n","found. now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you \n","ask? \n","\n","do you wish for the house of elendil to return to the land of gondor?' \n","\n","'i was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a \n","riddle,' answered boromir proudly. 'yet we are hard pressed, and the sword \n","of elendil would be a help beyond our hope-if such a thing could indeed \n","return out of the shadows of the past.' he looked again at aragorn, and \n","doubt was in his eyes. \n","\n","frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his side. evidently he was annoyed \n","on his friend's behalf. standing suddenly up he burst out: \n","\n","all that is gold does not glitter, \n","\n","not all those who wander are lost; \n","\n","the old that is strong does not wither, \n","\n","deep roots are not reached by the frost. \n","\n","from the ashes a fire shall be woken, \n","\n","a light from the shadows shall spring; \n","\n","renewed shall be blade that was broken: \n","\n","the crownless again shall be king. \n","\n","'not very good perhaps, but to the point - if you need more beyond the \n","word of elrond. if that was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to \n","hear, you had best listen to it.' he sat down with a snort. \n","\n","'i made that up myself,' he whispered to frodo, 'for the dnadan, a \n","long time ago when he first told me about himself. i almost wish that my \n","adventures were not over, and that i could go with him when his day comes.' \n","\n","aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to boromir again. 'for my part i \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","forgive your doubt,' he said. 'little do i resemble the figures of elendil \n","and isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of denethor. \n","\n","i am but the heir of isildur, not isildur himself. i have had a hard life \n","and a long; and the leagues that lie between here and gondor are a small \n","part in the count of my journeys. i have crossed many mountains and many \n","rivers, and trodden many plains, even into the far countries of rhyn and \n","harad where the stars are strange. \n","\n","'but my home, such as i have, is in the north. for here the heirs of \n","valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many \n","generations. our days have darkened, and we have dwindled; but ever the \n","sword has passed to a new keeper. and this i will say to you, boromir, ere i \n","end. lonely men are we, rangers of the wild, hunters- but hunters ever of \n","the servants of the enemy; for they are found in many places, not in mordor \n","only. \n","\n","'if gondor, boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another \n","part. many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do \n","not stay. you know little of the lands beyond your bounds. peace and \n","freedom, do you say? the north would have known them little but for us. fear \n","would have destroyed them. but when dark things come from the houseless \n","hills, or creep from sunless woods, they fly from us. what roads would any \n","dare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands, or in the homes of \n","simple men at night, if the dnedain were asleep, or were all gone into the \n","grave? \n","\n","'and yet less thanks have we than you. travellers scowl at us, and \n","countrymen give us scornful names. \"strider\" i am to one fat man who lives \n","within a day's march of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little \n","town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. yet we would not have it \n","otherwise. if simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be, \n","and we must be secret to keep them so. that has been the task of my kindred, \n","while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown. \n","\n","'but now the world is changing once again. a new hour comes. isildur's \n","bane is found. battle is at hand. the sword shall be reforged. i will come \n","to minas tirith.' \n","\n","'isildur's bane is found, you say,' said boromir. 'i have seen a bright \n","ring in the halfling's hand; but isildur perished ere this age of the world \n","began, they say. how do the wise know that this ring is his? and how has it \n","passed down the years, until it is brought hither by so strange a \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","messenger?' \n","\n","'that shall be told,' said elrond. \n","\n","'but not yet, i beg, master!' said bilbo. 'already the sun is climbing \n","to noon, and i feel the need of something to strengthen me.' \n","\n","'i had not named you,' said elrond smiling. 'but i do so now. come! \n","\n","tell us your tale. and if you have not yet cast your story into verse, you \n","may tell it in plain words. the briefer, the sooner shall you be refreshed.' \n","\n","'very well,' said bilbo. 'i will do as you bid. but i will now tell the \n","true story, and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise' - he looked \n","sidelong at gluin - l ask them to forget it and forgive me. i only wished \n","to claim the treasure as my very own in those days, and to be rid of the \n","name of thief that was put on me. but perhaps i understand things a little \n","better now. anyway, this is what happened.' \n","\n","to some there bilbo's tale was wholly new, and they listened with \n","amazement while the old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted \n","his adventure with gollum, at full length. he did not omit a single riddle. \n","\n","he would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the \n","shire, if he had been allowed; but elrond raised his hand. \n","\n","'well told, my friend,' he said, 'but that is enough at this time. for \n","the moment it suffices to know that the ring passed to frodo, your heir. let \n","him now speak!' \n","\n","then, less willingly than bilbo, frodo told of all his dealings with \n","the ring from the day that it passed into his keeping. every step of his \n","journey from hobbiton to the ford of bruinen was questioned and considered, \n","and everything that he could recall concerning the black riders was \n","examined. at last he sat down again. \n","\n","'not bad,' bilbo said to him. 'you would have made a good story of it, \n","if they hadn't kept on interrupting. i tried to make a few notes, but we \n","shall have to go over it all again together some time, if i am to write it \n","up. there are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!' \n","\n","'yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered frodo. 'but the story still \n","does not seem complete to me. i still want to know a good deal, especially \n","about gandalf.' \n","\n","galdor of the havens, who sat near by, overheard him. 'you speak for me \n","also,' he cried, and turning to elrond he said: 'the wise may have good \n","reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the great ring of long \n","debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less. but may we not \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","hear the proofs? and i would ask this also. what of saruman? he is learned \n","in the lore of the rings, yet he is not among us. what is his counsel-if he \n","knows the things that we have heard?' \n","\n","'the questions that you ask, galdor, are bound together,' said elrond. \n","\n","i had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered. but these things it \n","is the part of gandalf to make clear; and i call upon him last, for it is \n","the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.' \n","\n","'some, galdor,' said gandalf, 'would think the tidings of gluin, and \n","the pursuit of frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of \n","great worth to the enemy. yet it is a ring. what then? the nine the nazgyl \n","keep. the seven are taken or destroyed.' at this gluin stirred, but did not \n","speak. 'the three we know of. what then is this one that he desires so much? \n","\n","'there is indeed a wide waste of time between the river and the \n","mountain, between the loss and the finding. but the gap in the knowledge of \n","the wise has been filled at last. yet too slowly. for the enemy has been \n","close behind, closer even than i feared. and well is it that not until this \n","year, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth. \n","\n","'some here will remember that many years ago i myself dared to pass the \n","doors of the necromancer in dol guldur, and secretly explored his ways, and \n","found thus that our fears were true: he was none other than sauron, our \n","enemy of old, at length taking shape and power again. some, too, will \n","remember also that saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and \n","for \n","\n","long we watched him only. yet at last, as his shadow grew, saruman yielded, \n","and the council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of mirkwood \n","and that was in the very year of the finding of this ring: a strange chance, \n","if chance it was. \n","\n","'but we were too late, as elrond foresaw. sauron also had watched us, \n","and had long prepared against our stroke, governing mordor from afar through \n","minas morgul, where his nine servants dwelt, until all was ready. then he \n","gave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the \n","dark tower and openly declared himself. then for the last time the council \n","met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one. \n","we feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of. but \n","saruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that the one \n","would never again be found in middle-earth. \n","\n","\"at the worst,\" said he, \"our enemy knows that we have it not and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","that it still is lost. but what was lost may yet be found, he thinks. fear \n","not! his hope will cheat him. have i not earnestly studied this matter? into \n","anduin the great it fell; and long ago, while sauron slept, it was rolled \n","down the river to the sea. there let it lie until the end.'\" \n","\n","gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of \n","the misty mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long \n","lain hidden. he sighed. \n","\n","'there i was at fault,' he said. 'i was lulled by the words of saruman \n","the wise; but i should have sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would \n","now be less.' \n","\n","'we were all at fault,' said elrond, 'and but for your vigilance the \n","darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. but say on!' \n","\n","'from the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that i knew,' \n","said gandalf, 'and i desired to know how this thing came to gollum, and how \n","long he had possessed it. so i set a watch for him, guessing that he would \n","ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. he came, but \n","he escaped and was not found. and then alas ! i let the matter rest, watching \n","and waiting only, as we have too often done. \n","\n","'time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to \n","sudden fear. whence came the hobbit's ring? what, if my fear was true, \n","should be done with it? those things i must decide. but i spoke yet of my \n","dread to none, knowing the peril of an untimely whisper, if it went astray. \n","\n","in all the long wars with the dark tower treason has ever been our greatest \n","foe. \n","\n","'that was seventeen years ago. soon i became aware that spies of many \n","sorts, even beasts and birds, were gathered round the shire, and my fear \n","grew. i called for the help of the dnedain, and their watch was doubled; \n","and i opened my heart to aragorn, the heir of isildur.' \n","\n","'and i,' said aragorn, 'counselled that we should hunt for gollum. too \n","late though it may seem. and since it seemed fit that isildur's heir should \n","labour to repair isildur's fault, i went with gandalf on the long and \n","hopeless search.' \n","\n","then gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of wilderland, \n","down even to the mountains of shadow and the fences of mordor. 'there we \n","had \n","\n","rumour of him, and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but \n","we never found him, and at last i despaired. and then in my despair i \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","thought again of a test that might make the finding of gollum unneeded. the \n","ring itself might tell if it were the one. the memory of words at the \n","council came back to me: words of saruman, half-heeded at the time. i heard \n","them now clearly in my heart. \n","\n","' \"the nine, the seven, and the three,\" he said, \"had each their proper \n","gem. not so the one. it was round and unadorned, as it were one of the \n","lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could \n","still see and read.\" \n","\n","'what those marks were he had not said. who now would know? the \n","maker. \n","\n","and saruman? but great though his lore may be, it must have a source. what \n","hand save sauron's ever held this thing, ere it was lost? the hand of \n","isildur alone. \n","\n","'with that thought, i forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to gondor. \n","\n","in former days the members of my order had been well received there, but \n","saruman most of all. often he had been for long the guest of the lords of \n","the city. less welcome did the lord denethor show me then than of old, and \n","grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books. \n","\n","' \"if indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, \n","and the beginnings of the city, read on! \" he said. \"for to me what was is \n","less dark than what is to come, and that is my care. but unless you have \n","more skill even than saruman, who has studied here long, you will find \n","naught that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this \n","city.\" \n","\n","'so said denethor. and yet there lie in his hoards many records that \n","few now can read, even of the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues \n","have become dark to later men. and boromir, there lies in minas tirith \n","still, unread, i guess, by any save saruman and myself since the kings \n","failed, a scroll that isildur made himself. for isildur did not march away \n","straight from the war in mordor, as some have told the tale.' \n","\n","'some in the north, maybe,' boromir broke in. 'all know in gondor that \n","he went first to minas anor and dwelt a while with his nephew meneldil, \n","instructing him, before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom. \n","in that time he planted there the last sapling of the white tree in memory \n","of his brother.' \n","\n","'but in that time also he made this scroll,' said gandalf; 'and that is \n","not remembered in gondor, it would seem. for this scroll concerns the ring, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and thus wrote isildur therein: \n","\n","the great ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the north kingdom; but \n","records of it shall be left in gondor, where also dwell the heirs of \n","elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow \n","dim. \n","\n","'and after these words isildur described the ring, such as he found it. \n","\n","it was hot when i first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was \n","scorched, so that i doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it. \n","\n","yet even as i write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth \n","neither its beauty nor its shape. already the writing upon it, which at \n","first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read. \n","\n","it is fashioned in an elven-script of eregion, for they have no letters in \n","mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. i deem it to \n","be a tongue of the black land, since it is foul and uncouth. what evil it \n","saith i do not know; but i trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond \n","recall. the ring misseth, maybe, the heat of sauron's hand, which was black \n","and yet burned like fire, and so gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the \n","gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed, gut for my part i will \n","risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of sauron the only fair. it is \n","precious to me, though i buy it with great pain. \n","\n","'when i read these words, my quest was ended. for the traced writing \n","was indeed as isildur guessed, in the tongue of mordor and the servants of \n","the tower. and what was said therein was already known. for in the day that \n","sauron first put on the one, celebrimbor, maker of the three, was aware of \n","him, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes \n","were revealed. \n","\n","'at once i took my leave of denethor, but even as i went northwards, \n","messages came to me out of lurien that aragorn had passed that way, and that \n","he had found the creature called gollum. therefore i went first to meet him \n","and hear his tale. into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not \n","guess.' \n","\n","'there is little need to tell of them,' said aragorn. 'if a man must \n","needs walk in sight of the black gate, or tread the deadly flowers of morgul \n","vale, then perils he will have. i, too, despaired at last, and i began my \n","homeward journey. and then, by fortune, i came suddenly on what i sought: \n","the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. but now the trail was fresh and \n","swift, and it led not to mordor but away. along the skirts of the dead \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","marshes i followed it, and then i had him. lurking by a stagnant mere, \n","peering in the water as the dark eve fell, i caught him, gollum. he was \n","covered with green slime. he will never love me, i fear; for he bit me, and \n","i was not gentle. nothing more did i ever get from his mouth than the marks \n","of his teeth. i deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back, \n","watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his \n","neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever \n","towards mirkwood. i brought him there at last and gave him to the elves, for \n","we had agreed that this should be done; and i was glad to be rid of his \n","company, for he stank. for my part i hope never to look upon him again; but \n","gandalf came and endured long speech with him.' \n","\n","'yes, long and weary,' said gandalf, 'but not without profit. for one \n","thing, the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which bilbo has now \n","told openly for the first time; but that mattered little, since i had \n","already guessed it. but i learned then first that gollum's ring came out of \n","the great river nigh to the gladden fields. and i learned also that he had \n","possessed it long. many lives of his small kind. the power of the ring had \n","lengthened his years far beyond their span; but that power only the great \n","rings wield. \n","\n","'and if that is not proof enough, galdor, there is the other test that \n","i spoke of. upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft, round \n","and unadorned, the letters that isildur reported may still be read, if one \n","has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. that i \n","have done, and this i have read: \n","\n","ash nazg durbatulyk, ush nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulyk agh \n","burzum-ishi krimpatul. ' \n","\n","the change in the wizard's voice was astounding. suddenly it became \n","menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. a shadow seemed to pass over the high \n","sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. all trembled, and the elves \n","stopped their ears. \n","\n","'never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in \n","imladris, gandalf the grey,' said elrond, as the shadow passed and the \n","company breathed once more. \n","\n","'and let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,' answered \n","gandalf. 'nonetheless i do not ask your pardon, master elrond. for if that \n","tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the west, then let all put \n","doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the wise have declared: the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","treasure of the enemy, fraught with all his malice; and in it lies a great \n","part of his strength of old. out of the black years come the words that the \n","smiths of eregion heard, and knew that they had been betrayed: \n","\n","one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring \n","them all and in the darkness bind them. \n","\n","'know also, my friends, that i learned more yet from gollum. he was \n","loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt that he \n","went to mordor, and there all that he knew was forced from him. thus the \n","enemy knows now that the one is found, that it was long in the shire; and \n","since his servants have pursued it almost to our door, he soon will know, \n","already he may know, even as i speak, that we have it here.' \n","\n","all sat silent for a while, until at length boromir spoke. 'he is a \n","small thing, you say, this gollum? small, but great in mischief. what became \n","of him? to what doom did you put him?' \n","\n","'he is in prison, but no worse,' said aragorn. 'he had suffered much. \n","\n","there is no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear of sauron lies black \n","on his heart. still i for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful \n","elves of mirkwood. his malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be \n","believed in one so lean and withered. he could work much mischief still, if \n","he were free. and i do not doubt that he was allowed to leave mordor on some \n","evil errand.' \n","\n","'alas! alas!' cried legolas, and in his fair elvish face there was \n","great distress. 'the tidings that i was sent to bring must now be told. they \n","are not good, but only here have i learned how evil they may seem to this \n","company. smjagol, who is now called gollum, has escaped.' \n","\n","'escaped?' cried aragorn. 'that is ill news indeed. we shall all rue it \n","bitterly, i fear. how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their trust?' \n","\n","'not through lack of watchfulness,' said legolas; 'but perhaps through \n","over -kindliness. and we fear that the prisoner had aid from others, and that \n","more is known of our doings than we could wish. we guarded this creature day \n","and night, at gandalf s bidding, much though we wearied of the task. but \n","gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep \n","him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old \n","black thoughts.' \n","\n","'you were less tender to me,' said gluin with a flash of his eyes as \n","old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the deep places of the \n","elven-king's halls. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'now come!' said gandalf. 'pray do not interrupt, my good gluin. that \n","was a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. if all the grievances \n","that stand between elves and dwarves are to be brought up here, we may as \n","well abandon this council.' \n","\n","gluin rose and bowed, and legolas continued. 'in the days of fair \n","weather we led gollum through the woods; and there was a high tree standing \n","alone far from the others which he liked to climb. often we let him mount up \n","to the highest branches, until he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at \n","the tree's foot. one day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind \n","to climb after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his \n","feet as well as with his hands; so they sat by the tree far into the night. \n","\n","'it was that very night of summer, yet moonless and starless, that ores \n","came on us at unawares. we drove them off after some time; they were many \n","and fierce, but they came from over the mountains, and were unused to the \n","woods. when the battle was over, we found that gollum was gone, and his \n","guards were slain or taken. it then seemed plain to us that the attack had \n","been made for his rescue, and that he knew of it beforehand. how that was \n","contrived we cannot guess; but gollum is cunning, and the spies of the enemy \n","are many. the dark things that were driven out in the year of the dragon's \n","fall have returned in greater numbers, and mirkwood is again an evil place, \n","save where our realm is maintained. \n","\n","'we have failed to recapture gollum. we came on his trail among those \n","of many ores, and it plunged deep into the forest, going south. but ere long \n","it escaped our skill, and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were \n","drawing nigh to dol guldur, and that is still a very evil place; we do not \n","go that way.' \n","\n","'well, well, he is gone,' said gandalf. 'we have no time to seek for \n","him again. he must do what he will. but he may play a part yet that neither \n","he nor sauron have foreseen. \n","\n","'and now i will answer galdor's other questions. what of saruman? what \n","are his counsels to us in this need? this tale i must tell in full, for only \n","elrond has heard it yet, and that in brief, but it will bear on all that we \n","must resolve. it is the last chapter in the tale of the ring, so far as it \n","has yet gone. \n","\n","'at the end of june i was in the shire, but a cloud of anxiety was on \n","my mind, and i rode to the southern borders of the little land; for i had a \n","foreboding of some danger, still hidden from me but drawing near. there \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in gondor, and when i heard \n","of the black shadow a chill smote my heart. but i found nothing save a few \n","fugitives from the south; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of \n","which they would not speak. i turned then east and north and journeyed along \n","the greenway; and not far from bree i came upon a traveller sitting on a \n","bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. it was radagast the \n","brown, who at one time dwelt at rhosgobel, near the borders of mirkwood. \n","\n","he \n","\n","is one of my order, but i had not seen him for many a year. \n","\n","' \"gandalf ! \" he cried. \"i was seeking you. but i am a stranger in \n","these parts. all i knew was that you might be found in a wild region with \n","the uncouth name of shire.\" \n","\n","' \"your information was correct,\" i said. \"but do not put it that way, \n","if you meet any of the inhabitants. you are near the borders of the shire \n","now. and what do you want with me? it must be pressing. you were never a \n","traveller, unless driven by great need.\" \n","\n","' \"i have an urgent errand,\" he said. \"my news is evil.\" then he looked \n","about him, as if the hedges might have ears. \"nazgyl,\" he whispered. \"the \n","nine are abroad again. they have crossed the river secretly and are moving \n","westward. they have taken the guise of riders in black.\" \n","\n","'i knew then what i had dreaded without knowing it. \n","\n","\" \"the enemy must have some great need or purpose,\" said radagast; \"but \n","what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts, i cannot \n","guess.\" \n","\n","v \"what do you mean? \" said i. \n","\n","v \"i have been told that wherever they go the riders ask for news of a \n","land called shire.\" \n","\n","' \"the shire,\" i said; but my heart sank. for even the wise might fear \n","to withstand the nine, when they are gathered together under their fell \n","chieftain. a great king and sorcerer he was of old, and now he wields a \n","deadly fear. \"who told you, and who sent you? \" i asked. \n","\n","' \"saruman the white,\" answered radagast. \"and he told me to say that \n","if you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it \n","will be too late.\" \n","\n","'and that message brought me hope. for saruman the white is the \n","greatest of my order. radagast is, of course, a worthy wizard, a master of \n","shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","birds are especially his friends. but saruman has long studied the arts of \n","the enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. it was \n","by the devices of saruman that we drove him from dol guldur. it might be \n","that he had found some weapons that would drive back the nine. \n","\n","' \"i will go to saruman,\" i said. \n","\n","' \"then you must go now,\" said radagast; \"for i have wasted time in \n","looking for you, and the days are running short. i was told to find you \n","before midsummer, and that is now here. even if you set out from this spot, \n","you will hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek. \n","\n","i myself shall turn back at once.\" and with that he mounted and would have \n","ridden straight off. \n","\n","' \"stay a moment! \" i said. \"we shall need your help, and the help of \n","all things that will give it. send out messages to all the beasts and birds \n","that are your friends. tell them to bring news of anything that bears on \n","this matter to saruman and gandalf. let messages be sent to orthanc.\" \n","\n","\"i will do that,\" he said, and rode off as if the nine were after \n","\n","him. \n","\n","'i could not follow him then and there. i had ridden very far already \n","that day, and i was as weary as my horse; and i needed to consider matters. \n","\n","i stayed the night in bree, and decided that i had no time to return to the \n","shire. never did i make a greater mistake! \n","\n","'however, i wrote a message to frodo, and trusted to my friend the \n","innkeeper to send it to him. i rode away at dawn; and i came at long last to \n","the dwelling of saruman. that is far south in isengard, in the end of the \n","misty mountains, not far from the gap of rohan. and boromir will tell you \n","that that is a great open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the \n","northmost foothills of ered nimrais, the white mountains of his home. but \n","isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall, \n","and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called orthanc. it was \n","not made by saruman, but by the men of nmenor long ago; and it is very tall \n","and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. it cannot be \n","reached save by passing the circle of isengard; and in that circle there is \n","only one gate. \n","\n","'late one evening i came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of \n","rock; and it was strongly guarded. but the keepers of the gate were on the \n","watch for me and told me that saruman awaited me. i rode under the arch, and \n","the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly i was afraid, though i knew \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","no reason for it. \n","\n","'but i rode to the foot of orthanc, and came to the stair of saruman \n","and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber. he wore a ring on his \n","finger. \n","\n","\"so you have come, gandalf,\" he said to me gravely; but in his eyes \n","there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart. \n","\n","v \"yes, i have come,\" i said. \"i have come for your aid, saruman the \n","white.\" and that title seemed to anger him. \n","\n","' \"have you indeed, gandalf the grey l \" he scoffed. \"for aid? it has \n","seldom been heard of that gandalf the grey sought for aid, one so cunning \n","and so wise, wandering about the lands, and concerning himself in every \n","business, whether it belongs to him or not.\" \n","\n","'i looked at him and wondered. \"but if i am not deceived,\" said i, \n","\n","\"things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength.\" \n","\n","' \"that may be so,\" he said, \"but the thought is late in coming to you. \n","\n","how long. i wonder, have you concealed from me, the head of the council, a \n","matter of greatest import? what brings you now from your lurking-place in \n","the shire? \" \n","\n","' \"the nine have come forth again,\" i answered. \"they have crossed the \n","river. so radagast said to me.\" \n","\n","v \"radagast the brown! \" laughed saruman, and he no longer concealed \n","his scorn. \"radagast the bird-tamer! radagast the simple! radagast the fool! \n","yet he had just the wit to play the part that i set him. for you have come, \n","and that was all the purpose of my message. and here you will stay, gandalf \n","the grey, and rest from journeys. for i am saruman the wise, saruman \n","ring-maker, saruman of many colours! \" \n","\n","'i looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not \n","so, but were woven of all colours, and if he moved they shimmered and \n","changed hue so that the eye was bewildered. \n","\n","' \"i liked white better,\" i said. \n","\n","' \"white! \" he sneered. \"it serves as a beginning. white cloth may be \n","dyed. the white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.\" \n","\n","' \"in which case it is no longer white,\" said i. \"and he that breaks a \n","thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.\" \n","\n","' \"you need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for \n","friends,\" said he. \"i have not brought you hither to be instructed by you, \n","but to give you a choice.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'he drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a \n","speech long rehearsed. \"the elder days are gone. the middle days are \n","passing. the younger days are beginning. the time of the elves is over, but \n","our time is at hand: the world of men, which we must rule. but we must have \n","power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the \n","wise can see. \n","\n","' \"and listen, gandalf, my old friend and helper! \" he said, coming \n","near and speaking now in a softer voice. \"i said we, for we it may be, if \n","you will join with me. a new power is rising. against it the old allies and \n","policies will not avail us at all. there is no hope left in elves or dying \n","nmenor. this then is one choice before you. before us. we may join with \n","that power. it would be wise, gandalf. there is hope that way. its victory \n","is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it. as the \n","power grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the wise, such as you \n","and i, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. \n","\n","we can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring \n","maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: \n","knowledge, rule, order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain \n","to accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends. \n","there need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs, only \n","in our means.\" \n","\n","' \"saruman,\" i said, \"i have heard speeches of this kind before, but \n","only in the mouths of emissaries sent from mordor to deceive the ignorant. i \n","cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears.\" \n","\n","'he looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. \"well, i see \n","that this wise course does not commend itself to you,\" he said. \"not yet? \n","\n","not if some better way can be contrived? \" \n","\n","'he came and laid his long hand on my arm. \"and why not, gandalf? \" he \n","whispered. \"why not? the ruling ring? if we could command that, then the \n","power would pass to us. that is in truth why i brought you here. for i have \n","many eyes in my service, and i believe that you know where this precious \n","thing now lies. is it not so? or why do the nine ask for the shire, and what \n","is your business there? \" as he said this a lust which he could not conceal \n","shone suddenly in his eyes. \n","\n","' \"saruman,\" i said, standing away from him, \"only one hand at a time \n","can wield the one, and you know that well, so do not trouble to say we! but \n","i would not give it, nay, i would not give even news of it to you, now that \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","i learn your mind. you were head of the council, but you have unmasked \n","yourself at last. well, the choices are, it seems, to submit to sauron, or \n","to yourself. i will take neither. have you others to offer? \" \n","\n","'he was cold now and perilous. \"yes,\" he said. \"i did not expect you to \n","show wisdom, even in your own behalf; but i gave you the chance of aiding me \n","willingly, and so saving yourself much trouble and pain. the third choice is \n","to stay here, until the end.\" \n","\n","' \"until what end? \" \n","\n","' \"until you reveal to me where the one may be found. i may find means \n","to persuade you. or until it is found in your despite, and the ruler has \n","time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the \n","hindrance and insolence of gandalf the grey.\" \n","\n","' \"that may not prove to be one of the lighter matters,\" said i. he \n","laughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it. \n","\n","'they took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of orthanc, in the \n","place where saruman was accustomed to watch the stars. there is no descent \n","save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps, and the valley below seems \n","far away. i looked on it and saw that, whereas it had once been green and \n","fair, it was now filled with pits and forges. wolves and ores were housed in \n","isengard, for saruman was mustering a great force on his own account, in \n","rivalry of sauron and not in his service yet. over all his works a dark \n","smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of orthanc. i stood alone on \n","an island in the clouds; and i had no chance of escape, and my days were \n","bitter. i was pierced with cold, and i had but little room in which to pace \n","to and fro, brooding on the coming of the riders to the north. \n","\n","'that the nine had indeed arisen i felt assured, apart from the words \n","of saruman which might be lies. long ere i came to isengard i had heard \n","tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. fear was ever in my heart for \n","my friends in the shire; but still i had some hope. i hoped that frodo had \n","set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached rivendell \n","before the deadly pursuit began. and both my fear and my hope proved \n","ill-founded. for my hope was founded on a fat man in bree; and my fear was \n","founded on the cunning of sauron. but fat men who sell ale have many calls \n","to answer; and the power of sauron is still less than fear makes it. but in \n","the circle of isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the \n","hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the shire far \n","away.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'i saw you!' cried frodo. 'you were walking backwards and forwards. the \n","moon shone in your hair.' \n","\n","gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. 'it was only a dream' said \n","frodo, 'but it suddenly came back to me. i had quite forgotten it. it came \n","some time ago; after i left the shire, i think.' \n","\n","'then it was late in coming,' said gandalf, 'as you will see. i was in \n","an evil plight. and those who know me will agree that i have seldom been in \n","such need, and do not bear such misfortune well. gandalf the grey caught \n","like a fly in a spider's treacherous web! yet even the most subtle spiders \n","may leave a weak thread. \n","\n","'at first i feared, as saruman no doubt intended, that radagast had \n","also fallen. yet i had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in \n","his eye at our meeting. if i had, i should never have gone to isengard, or i \n","should have gone more warily. so saruman guessed, and he had concealed his \n","mind and deceived his messenger. it would have been useless in any case to \n","try and win over the honest radagast to treachery. he sought me in good \n","faith, and so persuaded me. \n","\n","'that was the undoing of saruman's plot. for radagast knew no reason \n","why he should not do as i asked; and he rode away towards mirkwood where \n","he \n","\n","had many friends of old. and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide, \n","and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of ores; \n","and the nine riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard \n","news of the escape of gollum. and they sent a messenger to bring these \n","tidings to me. \n","\n","'so it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and \n","gwaihir the windlord, swiftest of the great eagles, came unlooked-for to \n","orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle. then i spoke to him and \n","he bore me away, before saruman was aware. i was far from isengard, ere the \n","wolves and ores issued from the gate to pursue me. \n","\n","' \"how far can you bear me? \" i said to gwaihir. \n","\n","' \"many leagues,\" said he, \"but not to the ends of the earth. i was \n","sent to bear tidings not burdens.\" \n","\n","' \"then i must have a steed on land,\" i said, \"and a steed surpassingly \n","swift, for i have never had such need of haste before.\" \n","\n","' \"then i will bear you to edoras, where the lord of rohan sits in his \n","halls,\" he said; \"for that is not very far off.\" and i was glad, for in the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","riddermark of rohan the rohirrim, the horse-lords, dwell, and there are no \n","horses like those that are bred in that great vale between the misty \n","mountains and the white. \n","\n","' \"are the men of rohan still to be trusted, do you think? \" i said to \n","gwaihir, for the treason of saruman had shaken my faith. \n","\n","' \"they pay a tribute of horses,\" he answered, \"and send many yearly to \n","mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke. but if \n","saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long \n","delayed.\" \n","\n","'he set me down in the land of rohan ere dawn; and now i have \n","lengthened my tale over long. the rest must be more brief. in rohan i found \n","evil already at work: the lies of saruman; and the king of the land would \n","not listen to my warnings. he bade me take a horse and be gone; and i chose \n","one much to my liking, but little to his. i took the best horse in his land, \n","and i have never seen the like of him.' \n","\n","'then he must be a noble beast indeed,' said aragorn; 'and it grieves \n","me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that sauron levies \n","such tribute. it was not so when last i was in that land.' \n","\n","'nor is it now, i will swear,' said boromir. 'it is a lie that comes \n","from the enemy. i know the men of rohan; true and valiant, our allies, \n","dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.' \n","\n","'the shadow of mordor lies on distant lands,' answered aragorn. \n","'saruman has fallen under it. rohan is beset. who knows what you will find \n","there, if ever you return?' \n","\n","'not this at least.' said boromir, 'that they will buy their lives with \n","horses. they love their horses next to their kin. and not without reason, \n","for the horses of the riddermark come from the fields of the north, far from \n","the shadow, and their race, as that of their masters, is descended from the \n","free days of old.' \n","\n","'true indeed!' said gandalf. 'and there is one among them that might \n","have been foaled in the morning of the world. the horses of the nine cannot \n","vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind. shadowfax they called \n","him. by day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade, \n","and he passes unseen. light is his footfall! never before had any man \n","mounted him, but i took him and i tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that \n","i reached the shire when frodo was on the barrow-downs, though i set out \n","from rohan only when he set out from hobbiton. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'but fear grew in me as i rode. ever as i came north i heard tidings of \n","the riders, and though i gained on them day by day, they were ever before \n","me. they had divided their forces, i learned: some remained on the eastern \n","borders, not far from the greenway. and some invaded the shire from the \n","south. i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone; but i had words with old \n","gamgee. many words and few to the point. he had much to say about the \n","shortcomings of the new owners of bag end. \n","\n","' \"i can't abide changes,\" said he, \"not at my time of life, and least \n","of all changes for the worst.\" \"changes for the worst,\" he repeated many \n","times. \n","\n","' \"worst is a bad word,\" i said to him, \"and i hope you do not live to \n","see it.\" but amidst his talk i gathered at last that frodo had left hobbiton \n","less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the hill the \n","same evening. then i rode on in fear. i came to buckland and found it in \n","uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. i came \n","to the house at crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the \n","threshold there lay a cloak that had been frodo's. then for a while hope \n","left me, and i did not wait to gather news, or i might have been comforted; \n","but i rode on the trail of the riders. it was hard to follow, for it went \n","many ways, and i was at a loss. but it seemed to me that one or two had \n","ridden towards bree; and that way i went, for i thought of words that might \n","be said to the innkeeper. \n","\n","' \"butterbur they call him,\" thought i. \"if this delay was his fault, i \n","will melt all the butter in him. i will roast the old fool over a slow \n","fire.\" he expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and \n","began to melt on the spot.' \n","\n","'what did you do to him?' cried frodo in alarm. 'he was really very \n","kind to us and did all that he could.' \n","\n","gandalf laughed. 'don't be afraid!' he said. 'i did not bite, and i \n","barked very little. so overjoyed was i by the news that i got out of him, \n","when he stopped quaking, that i embraced the old fellow. how it happened i \n","could not then guess, but i learned that you had been in bree the night \n","before, and had gone off that morning with strider. \n","\n","' \"strider! \" i cried, shouting for joy. \n","\n","\"yes, sir, i am afraid so, sir,\" said butterbur, mistaking me. \"he \n","got at them, in spite of all that i could do, and they took up with him. \n","\n","they behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say.\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\"ass! fool! thrice worthy and beloved barliman! \" said i. \"it's the \n","best news i have had since midsummer: it's worth a gold piece at the least. \n","may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for \n","seven years! \" said i. \"now i can take a night's rest, the first since i \n","have forgotten when.\" \n","\n","'sol stayed there that night, wondering much what had become of the \n","riders; for only of two had there yet been any news in bree, it seemed. but \n","in the night we heard more. five at least came from the west, and they threw \n","down the gates and passed through bree like a howling wind; and the \n","bree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world. i got up \n","before dawn and went after them. \n","\n","'i do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened. \n","\n","their captain remained in secret away south of bree, while two rode ahead \n","through the village, and four more invaded the shire. but when these were \n","foiled in bree and at crickhollow, they returned to their captain with \n","tidings, and so left the road unguarded for a while, except by their spies. \n","\n","the captain then sent some eastward straight across country, and he himself \n","with the rest rode along the road in great wrath. \n","\n","'i galloped to weathertop like a gale, and i reached it before sundown \n","on my second day from bree-and they were there before me. they drew \n","away \n","\n","from me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it \n","while the sun was in the sky. but they closed round at night, and i was \n","besieged on the hill -top, in the old ring of amon syl. i was hard put to it \n","indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the \n","war-beacons of old. \n","\n","'at sunrise i escaped and fled towards the north. i could not hope to \n","do more. it was impossible to find you, frodo, in the wilderness, and it \n","would have been folly to try with all the nine at my heels. sol had to \n","trust to aragorn. but i hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach \n","rivendell ahead of you and send out help. four riders did indeed follow me, \n","but they turned back after a while and made for the ford, it seems. that \n","helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was \n","attacked. \n","\n","'i reached here at last by a long hard road, up the floarwell and \n","through the ettenmoors, and down from the north. it took me nearly fourteen \n","days from weathertop, for i could not ride among the rocks of the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","troll-fells, and shadowfax departed. i sent him back to his master; but a \n","great friendship has grown between us, and if i have need he will come at my \n","call. but so it was that i came to rivendell only three days before the \n","ring, and news of its peril had already been brought here-which proved well \n","indeed. \n","\n","'and that, frodo, is the end of my account. may elrond and the others \n","forgive the length of it. but such a thing has not happened before, that \n","gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised. an account to the \n","ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, i think. \n","\n","'well, the tale is now told, from first to last. here we all are, and \n","here is the ring. but we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose. what \n","shall we do with it?' \n","\n","there was silence. at last elrond spoke again. \n","\n","'this is grievous news concerning saruman,' he said; 'for we trusted \n","him and he is deep in all our counsels. it is perilous to study too deeply \n","the arts of the enemy, for good or for ill. but such falls and betrayals, \n","alas, have happened before. of the tales that we have heard this day the \n","tale of frodo was most strange to me. i have known few hobbits, save bilbo \n","here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as i \n","had thought him. the world has changed much since i last was on the \n","westward \n","roads. \n","\n","'the barrow- wights we know by many names; and of the old forest \n","many \n","\n","tales have been told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern \n","march. time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now \n","the shire to dunland west of isengard. in those lands i journeyed once, and \n","many things wild and strange i knew. but i had forgotten bombadil, if indeed \n","this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even \n","then was older than the old. that was not then his name. iarwain ben-adar we \n","called him, oldest and fatherless. but many another name he has since been \n","given by other folk: forn by the dwarves, orald by northern men, and other \n","names beside. he is a strange creature, but maybe i should have summoned \n","him \n","\n","to our council.' \n","\n","'he would not have come,' said gandalf. \n","\n","'could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?' asked \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","erestor. 'it seems that he has a power even over the ring.' \n","\n","'no, i should not put it so,' said gandalf. 'say rather that the ring \n","has no power over him. he is his own master. but he cannot alter the ring \n","itself, nor break its power over others. and now he is withdrawn into a \n","little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, \n","waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them.' \n","\n","'but within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,' said erestor. \n","'would he not take the ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?' \n","\n","'no,' said gandalf, 'not willingly. he might do so, if all the free \n","folk of the world begged him, but he would not understand the need. and if \n","he were given the ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it \n","away. such things have no hold on his mind. he would be a most unsafe \n","guardian; and that alone is answer enough.' \n","\n","'but in any case,' said glorfindel, 'to send the ring to him would only \n","postpone the day of evil. he is far away. we could not now take it back to \n","him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. and even if we could, soon or late the \n","lord of the rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his \n","power towards it. could that power be defied by bombadil alone? i think not. \n","\n","i think that in the end, if all else is conquered, bombadil will fall, last \n","as he was first; and then night will come.' \n","\n","'i know little of iarwain save the name,' said galdor; 'but glorfindel, \n","\n","i think, is right. power to defy our enemy is not in him, unless such power \n","is in the earth itself. and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy \n","the very hills. what power still remains lies with us, here in imladris, or \n","with cirdan at the havens, or in lurien. but have they the strength, have we \n","here the strength to withstand the enemy, the coming of sauron at the last, \n","when all else is overthrown?' \n","\n","'i have not the strength,' said elrond; 'neither have they.' \n","\n","'then if the ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strength' said \n","glorfindel, 'two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the \n","sea, or to destroy it.' \n","\n","'but gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft \n","that we here possess,' said elrond. 'and they who dwell beyond the sea would \n","not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to middle-earth; it is for us who \n","still dwell here to deal with it.' \n","\n","'then, said glorfindel, 'let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the \n","lies of saruman come true. for it is clear now that even at the council his \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","feet were already on a crooked path. he knew that the ring was not lost for \n","ever, but wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself. \n","\n","yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the sea it would be safe.' \n","\n","'not safe for ever,' said gandalf. 'there are many things in the deep \n","waters; and seas and lands may change. and it is not our part here to take \n","thought only for a season, or for a few lives of men, or for a passing age \n","of the world. we should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not \n","hope to make one.' \n","\n","'and that we shall not find on the roads to the sea,' said galdor. 'if \n","the return to iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight to the s,a is \n","now fraught with gravest peril. my heart tells me that sauron will expect us \n","to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. he soon will. the \n","nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite, ere they find new \n","steeds and swifter. only the waning might of gondor stands now between him \n","and a march in power along the coasts into the north; and if he comes, \n","assailing the white towers and the havens, hereafter the elves may have no \n","escape from the lengthening shadows of middle-earth.' \n","\n","'long yet will that march be delayed,' said boromir. 'gondor wanes, you \n","say. but gondor stands, and even the end of its strength is still very \n","strong.' \n","\n","'and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine,' said galdor. \n","\n","'and other roads he may find that gondor does not guard.' \n","\n","'then,' said erestor, 'there are but two courses, as glorfindel already \n","has declared: to hide the ring for ever; or to unmake it. but both are \n","beyond our power. who will read this riddle for us?' \n","\n","'none here can do so,' said elrond gravely. 'at least none can foretell \n","what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. but it seems to me now \n","clear which is the road that we must take. the westward road seems easiest. \n","therefore it must be shunned. it will be watched. too often the elves have \n","fled that way. now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. \n","there lies our hope, if hope it be. to walk into peril-to mordor. we must \n","send the ring to the fire.' \n","\n","silence fell again. frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a \n","sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in \n","his heart. boromir stirred, and frodo looked at him. he was fingering his \n","great horn and frowning. at length he spoke. \n","\n","'i do not understand all this,' he said. 'saruman is a traitor, but did \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","he not have a glimpse of wisdom? why do you speak ever of hiding and \n","destroying? why should we not think that the great ring has come into our \n","hands to serve us in the very hour of need? wielding it the free lords of \n","the free may surely defeat the enemy. that is what he most fears, i deem. \n","\n","the men of gondor are valiant, and they will never submit; but they \n","may be beaten down. valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. let the \n","ring be your weapon, if it has such power as you say. take it and go forth \n","to victory!' \n","\n","'alas, no,' said elrond. 'we cannot use the ruling ring. that we now \n","know too well. it belongs to sauron and was made by him alone, and is \n","altogether evil. its strength, boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at \n","will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. but for \n","them it holds an even deadlier peril. the very desire of it corrupts the \n","heart. consider saruman. if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow \n","the lord of mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on \n","sauron's throne, and yet another dark lord would appear. and that is another \n","reason why the ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it \n","will be a danger even to the wise. for nothing is evil in the beginning. \n","even sauron was not so. i fear to take the ring to hide it. i will not take \n","the ring to wield it.' \n","\n","'nor i,' said gandalf. \n","\n","boromir looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. 'so be it,' \n","he said. 'then in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have. and at \n","the least, while the wise ones guard this ring, we will fight on. mayhap the \n","sword-that-was-broken may still stem the tide - if the hand that wields it \n","has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the kings of men.' \n","\n","'who can tell?' said aragorn. 'but we will put it to the test one day.' \n","\n","'may the day not be too long delayed,' said boromir. 'for though i do \n","not ask for aid, we need it. it would comfort us to know that others fought \n","also with all the means that they have.' \n","\n","'then be comforted,' said elrond. 'for there are other powers and \n","realms that you know not, and they are hidden from you. anduin the great \n","flows past many shores, ere it comes to argonath and the gates of gondor.' \n","\n","'still it might be well for all,' said gluin the dwarf, 'if all these \n","strengths were joined, and the powers of each were used in league. other \n","rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. the \n","seven are lost to us - if balin has not found the ring of thrur which was \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the last; naught has been heard of it since thrur perished in moria. indeed \n","i may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that balin \n","went away.' \n","\n","'balin will find no ring in moria,' said gandalf. 'thrur gave it to \n","thrbin his son, but not thrbin to thorin. it was taken with torment from \n","thrbin in the dungeons of dol guldur. i came too late.' \n","\n","'ah, alas!' cried gluin. 'when will the day come of our revenge? but \n","still there are the three. what of the three rings of the elves? very mighty \n","rings, it is said. do not the elf-lords keep them? yet they too were made by \n","the dark lord long ago. are they idle? i see elf-lords here. will they not \n","say?' \n","\n","the elves returned no answer. 'did you not hear me, gluin?' said \n","elrond. 'the three were not made by sauron, nor did he ever touch them. but \n","of them it is not permitted to speak. so much only in this' hour of doubt i \n","may now say. they are not idle. but they were not made as weapons of war or \n","conquest: that is not their power. those who made them did not desire \n","strength or domination or hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and \n","healing, to preserve all things unstained. these things the elves of \n","middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. but all that \n","has been wrought by those who wield the three will turn to their undoing, \n","and their minds and hearts will become revealed to sauron, if he regains the \n","one. it would be better if the three had never been. that is his purpose.' \n","\n","'but what then would happen, if the ruling ring were destroyed as you \n","counsel?' asked gluin. \n","\n","'we know not for certain,' answered elrond sadly. 'some hope that the \n","three rings, which sauron has never touched, would then become free, and \n","their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought. but \n","maybe when the one has gone, the three will fail, and many fair things will \n","fade and be forgotten. that is my belief.' \n","\n","'yet all the elves are willing to endure this chance,' said glorfindel \n","'if by it the power of sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be \n","taken away for ever.' \n","\n","'thus we return once more to the destroying of the ring,' said erestor, \n","\n","'and yet we come no nearer. what strength have we for the finding of the \n","fire in which it was made? that is the path of despair. of folly i would \n","say, if the long wisdom of elrond did not forbid me.' \n","\n","'despair, or folly?' said gandalf. 'it is not despair, for despair is \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. we do not. it is wisdom to \n","recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as \n","folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. well, let folly be our \n","cloak, a veil before the eyes of the enemy! for he is very wise, and weighs \n","all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice. but the only measure \n","that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. into \n","his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having \n","the ring we may seek to destroy it. if we seek this, we shall put him out of \n","reckoning.' \n","\n","'at least for a while,' said elrond. 'the road must be trod, but it \n","will be very hard. and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon \n","it. this quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. \n","yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small \n","hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.' \n","\n","'very well, very well, master elrond!' said bilbo suddenly. 'say no \n","more! it is plain enough what you are pointing at. bilbo the silly hobbit \n","started this affair, and bilbo had better finish it, or himself. i was very \n","comfortable here, and getting on with my book. if you want to know, i am \n","just writing an ending for it. i had thought of putting: and he lived \n","happily ever afterwards to the end of his days. it is a good ending, and \n","none the worse for having been used before. now i shall have to alter that: \n","it does not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to \n","be several more chapters, if i live to write them. it is a frightful \n","nuisance. when ought i to start? \n","\n","' boromir looked in surprise at bilbo, but the laughter died on his \n","lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave \n","respect. only gluin smiled, but his smile came from old memories. \n","\n","'of course, my dear bilbo,' said gandalf. 'if you had really started \n","this affair, you might be expected to finish it. but you know well enough \n","now that starting is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part \n","is played in great deeds by any hero. you need not bow! though the word was \n","meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. \n","\n","but one beyond your strength, bilbo. you cannot take this thing back. it has \n","passed on. if you need my advice any longer, i should say that your part is \n","ended, unless as a recorder. finish your book, and leave the ending \n","unaltered! there is still hope for it. but get ready to write a sequel, when \n","they come back.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo laughed. 'i have never known you give me pleasant advice before.' \n","he said. 'as all your unpleasant advice has been good, i wonder if this \n","advice is not bad. still, i don't suppose i have the strength or luck left \n","to deal with the ring. it has grown, and i have not. but tell me: what do \n","you mean by they? \n","\n","'the messengers who are sent with the ring.' \n","\n","'exactly! and who are they to be? that seems to me what this council \n","has to decide, and all that it has to decide. elves may thrive on speech \n","alone, and dwarves endure great weariness; but i am only an old hobbit, and \n","i miss my meal at noon. can't you think of some names now? or put it off \n","till after dinner?' \n","\n","no one answered. the noon-bell rang. still no one spoke. frodo glanced \n","at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. all the council sat with \n","downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. a great dread fell on him, as if he \n","was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and \n","vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. an overwhelming longing to \n","rest and remain at peace by bilbo's side in rivendell filled all his heart. \n","\n","at last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if \n","some other will was using his small voice. \n","\n","'i will take the ring,' he said, 'though i do not know the way.' \n","\n","elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and frodo felt his heart \n","pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. 'if i understand aright all \n","that i have heard,' he said, 'i think that this task is appointed for you, \n","\n","frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will. this is the hour of \n","the shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers \n","and counsels of the great. who of all the wise could have foreseen it? or, \n","if they are wise, why should they expect to know it, until the hour has \n","struck? \n","\n","'but it is a heavy burden. so heavy that none could lay it on another. \n","\n","i do not lay it on you. but if you take it freely, i will say that your \n","choice is right; and though all the mighty elf-friends of old, hador, and \n","hrin, and trin, and beren himself were assembled together your seat \n","should \n","\n","be among them.' \n","\n","'but you won't send him off alone surely, master?' cried sam, unable to \n","contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been \n","quietly sitting on the floor. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'no indeed!' said elrond, turning towards him with a smile. 'you at \n","least shall go with him. it is hardly possible to separate you from him, \n","even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.' \n","\n","sam sat down, blushing and muttering. 'a nice pickle we have landed \n","ourselves in, mr. frodo!' he said, shaking his head. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 3 . the ring goes south \n","\n","\n","\n","later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in bilbo's room. \n","merry and pippin were indignant when they heard that sam had crept into the \n","council, and had been chosen as frodo's companion. \n","\n","'it's most unfair,' said pippin. 'instead of throwing him out, and \n","clapping him in chains, elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!' \n","\n","'rewards!' said frodo. 'i can't imagine a more severe punishment. you \n","are not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on this hopeless \n","journey, a reward? yesterday i dreamed that my task was done, and i could \n","rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.' \n","\n","'i don't wonder,' said merry, 'and i wish you could. but we are envying \n","sam, not you. if you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us \n","to be left behind, even in rivendell. we have come a long way with you and \n","been through some stiff times. we want to go on.' \n","\n","'that's what i meant,' said pippin. 'we hobbits ought to stick \n","together, and we will. i shall go, unless they chain me up. there must be \n","someone with intelligence in the party.' \n","\n","'then you certainly will not be chosen, peregrin took!' said gandalf, \n","looking in through the window, which was near the ground. 'but you are all \n","worrying yourselves unnecessarily. nothing is decided yet.' \n","\n","'nothing decided!' cried pippin. 'then what were you all doing? you \n","were shut up for hours.' \n","\n","\"talking,' said bilbo. 'there was a deal of talk, and everyone had an \n","eye-opener. even old gandalf. i think legolas's bit of news about gollum \n","caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.' \n","\n","'you were wrong,' said gandalf. 'you were inattentive. i had already \n","heard of it from gwaihir. if you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as \n","you put it, were you and frodo; and i was the only one that was not \n","surprised.' \n","\n","'well, anyway,' said bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor \n","frodo and sam. i was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if i \n","was let off. but if you ask me, elrond will send out a fair number, when the \n","reports come in. have they started yet, gandalf?' \n","\n","'yes,' said the wizard. 'some of the scouts have been sent out already. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","more will go tomorrow. elrond is sending elves, and they will get in touch \n","with the rangers, and maybe with thranduil's folk in mirkwood. and \n","aragorn \n","\n","has gone with elrond's sons. we shall have to scour the lands all round for \n","many long leagues before any move is made. so cheer up, frodo! you will \n","probably make quite along stay here.' \n","\n","'ah!' said sam gloomily. 'we'll just wait long enough for winter to \n","come.' \n","\n","'that can't be helped,' said bilbo. 'it's your fault partly, frodo my \n","lad: insisting on waiting for my birthday. a funny way of honouring it, i \n","can't help thinking. not the day i should have chosen for letting the s.-b.s \n","into bag end. but there it is: you can't wait now fill spring; and you can't \n","go till the reports come back. \n","\n","when winter first begins to bite \n","and stones crack in the frosty night, \n","when pools are black and trees are bare, \n","\n","'tis evil in the wild to fare. \n","\n","but that i am afraid will be just your luck.' \n","\n","'i am afraid it will,' said gandalf. 'we can't start until we have \n","found out about the riders.' \n","\n","t thought they were all destroyed in the flood,' said merry. \n","\n","'you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that,' said gandalf. 'the power of \n","their master is in them, and they stand or fall by him. we hope that they \n","were all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made for a while less dangerous; but \n","we must find out for certain. in the meantime you should try and forget your \n","troubles, frodo. i do not know if i can do anything to help you; but i will \n","whisper this in your ears. someone said that intelligence would be needed in \n","the party. he was right. i think i shall come with you.' \n","\n","so great was frodo's delight at this announcement that gandalf left the \n","window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed. 'i \n","only said i think i shall come. do not count on anything yet. in this matter \n","elrond will have much to say, and your friend the strider. which reminds me, \n","i want to see elrond. i must be off.' \n","\n","'how long do you think i shall have here?' said frodo to bilbo when \n","gandalf had gone. \n","\n","'oh, i don't know. i can't count days in rivendell,' said bilbo. 'but \n","quite long, i should think. we can have many a good talk. what about helping \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","me with my book, and making a start on the next? have you thought of an \n","ending?' \n","\n","'yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,' said frodo. \n","\n","'oh, that won't do!' said bilbo. 'books ought to have good endings. how \n","would this do: and they all settled down and lived together happily ever \n","after?' \n","\n","'it will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said frodo. \n","\n","'ah!' said sam. 'and where will they live? that's what i often wonder.' \n","\n","for a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey \n","and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of \n","rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. the \n","future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over \n","the present. health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with \n","each good day as it came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word \n","and song. \n","\n","so the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and \n","each evening followed cool and clear. but autumn was waning fast; slowly the \n","golden light faded to pale silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the \n","naked trees. a wind began to blow chill from the misty mountains to the \n","east. the hunter's moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all \n","the lesser stars. but low in the south one star shone red. every night, as \n","the moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. frodo could see it \n","from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared \n","above the trees on the brink of the valley. \n","\n","the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of elrond, and \n","november had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and december was \n","passing, when the scouts began to return. some had gone north beyond the \n","springs of the hoarwell into the ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and \n","with the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the lands far down the \n","greyflood, as far as tharbad, where the old north road crossed the river by \n","a ruined town. many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed \n","the mountains and entered mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the \n","source of the gladden river, and had come down into wilderland and over the \n","gladden fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at \n","rhosgobel. radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass \n","that was called the dimrill stair. the sons of elrond, elladan and elrohir, \n","were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak \n","to any save to elrond. \n","\n","in no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the \n","riders or other servants of the enemy. even from the eagles of the misty \n","mountains they had learned no fresh news. nothing had been seen or heard of \n","gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far \n","up the great river. three of the black horses had been found at once drowned \n","in the flooded ford. on the rocks of the rapids below it searchers \n","discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and \n","tattered. of the black riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was \n","their presence to be felt. it seemed that they had vanished from the north. \n","\n","'eight out of the nine are accounted for at least,' said gandalf. 'it \n","is rash to be too sure, yet i think that we may hope now that the \n","ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they \n","could to their master in mordor, empty and shapeless. \n","\n","tf that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt \n","again. of course the enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey \n","all the way to the borders of rivendell before they can pick up our trail. \n","\n","and if we are careful that will be hard to find. but we must delay no \n","longer.' \n","\n","elrond summoned the hobbits to him. he looked gravely at frodo. 'the \n","time has come,' he said. 'if the ring is to set out, it must go soon. but \n","those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or \n","force. they must pass into the domain of the enemy far from aid. do you \n","still hold to your word, frodo, that you will be the ring-bearer?' \n","\n","'i do,' said frodo. 'i will go with sam.' \n","\n","'then i cannot help you much, not even with counsel,' said elrond. 'i \n","can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieved i \n","do not know. the shadow has crept now to the feet of the mountains, and \n","draws nigh even to the borders of greyflood; and under the shadow all is \n","dark to me. you will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and \n","you \n","\n","may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. i will send out \n","messages, such as i can contrive, to those whom i know in the wide world; \n","but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or \n","come no quicker than you yourself. \n","\n","'and i will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","or fortune allows. the number must be few, since your hope is in speed and \n","secrecy. had i a host of elves in armour of the elder days, it would avail \n","little, save to arouse the power of mordor. \n","\n","'the company of the ring shall be nine; and the nine walkers shall be \n","set against the nine riders that are evil. with you and your faithful \n","servant, gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the \n","end of his labours. \n","\n","'for the rest, they shall represent the other free peoples of the \n","world: elves, dwarves, and men. legolas shall be for the elves; and gimli \n","son of gluin for the dwarves. they are willing to go at least to the passes \n","of the mountains, and maybe beyond. for men you shall have aragorn son of \n","arathorn, for the ring of isildur concerns him closely.' \n","\n","'strider!' said frodo. \n","\n","'yes,' he said with a smile. 'i ask leave once again to be your \n","companion, frodo.' \n","\n","'i would have begged you to come,' said frodo, 'only i thought you were \n","going to minas tirith with boromir.' \n","\n","'i am,' said aragorn. 'and the sword-that-was-broken shall be reforged \n","ere i set out to war. but your road and our road lie together for many \n","hundreds of miles. therefore boromir will also be in the company. he is a \n","valiant man.' \n","\n","'there remain two more to be found,' said elrond. \"these i will \n","consider. of my household i may find some that it seems good to me to send.' \n","\n","'but that will leave no place for us!' cried pippin in dismay. 'we \n","don't want to be left behind. we want to go with frodo.' \n","\n","'that is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies \n","ahead,' said elrond. \n","\n","'neither does frodo,' said gandalf, unexpectedly supporting pippin. \n","\n","'nor do any of us see clearly. it is true that if these hobbits understood \n","the danger, they would not dare to go. but they would still wish to go, or \n","wish that they dared, and be shamed and unhappy. i think, elrond, that in \n","this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to \n","great wisdom. even if you chose for us an elf-lord, such as glorfindel, he \n","could not storm the dark tower, nor open the road to the fire by the power \n","that is in him.' \n","\n","'you speak gravely,' said elrond, 'but i am in doubt. the shire, i \n","forebode, is not free now from peril; and these two i had thought to send \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","back there as messengers, to do what they could, according to the fashion of \n","their country, to warn the people of their danger. in any case, i judge that \n","the younger of these two, peregrin took, should remain. my heart is against \n","his going.' \n","\n","'then, master elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me \n","home tied in a sack,' said pippin. 'for otherwise i shall follow the \n","company.' \n","\n","'let it be so then. you shall go,' said elrond, and he sighed. 'now the \n","tale of nine is filled. in seven days the company must depart.' \n","\n","the sword of elendil was forged anew by elvish smiths, and on its blade \n","was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent moon and the \n","rayed sun, and about them was written many runes; for aragorn son of \n","arathorn was going to war upon the marches of mordor. very bright was that \n","sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, \n","and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. and \n","aragorn gave it a new name and called it andril, flame of the west. \n","\n","aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and \n","the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps \n","and books of lore that were in the house of elrond. sometimes frodo was with \n","them; but he was content to lean on their guidance, and he spent as much \n","time as he could with bilbo. \n","\n","in those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the hall \n","of fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of beren \n","and lthien and the winning of the great jewel; but in the day, while merry \n","and pippin were out and about, frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo in \n","his own small room. then bilbo would read passages from his book (which \n","still seemed very incomplete), or scraps of his verses, or would take notes \n","of frodo's adventures. \n","\n","on the morning of the last day frodo was alone with bilbo, and the old \n","hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. he lifted the lid and \n","fumbled inside. \n","\n","'here is your sword,' he said. 'but it was broken, you know. i took it \n","to keep it safe but i've forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it. no \n","time now.. so i thought, perhaps, you would care to have this, don't you \n","know?' \n","\n","he took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. \n","then he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","cold and bright. this is sting,' he said, and thrust it with little effort \n","deep into a wooden beam. 'take it, if you like. i shan't want it again, i \n","expect.' \n","\n","frodo accepted it gratefully. \n","\n","'also there is this!' said bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to \n","be rather heavy for its size. he unwound several folds of old cloth, and \n","held up a small shirt of mail. it was close-woven of many rings, as supple \n","almost as linen, cold as ice, and harder than steel. it shone like moonlit \n","silver, and was studded with white gems. with it was a belt of pearl and \n","crystal. \n","\n","'it's a pretty thing, isn't it?' said bilbo, moving it in the light. \n","\n","'and useful. it is my dwarf-mail that thorin gave me. i got it back from \n","michel delving before i started, and packed it with my luggage: i brought \n","all the mementoes of my journey away with me, except the ring. but i did not \n","expect to use this, and i don't need it now, except to look at sometimes. \n","\n","you hardly feel any weight when you put it on.' \n","\n","'i should look - well, i don't think i should look right in it,' said \n","frodo. \n","\n","'just what i said myself,' said bilbo. 'but never mind about looks. you \n","can wear it under your outer clothes. come on! you must share this secret \n","with me. don't tell anybody else! but i should feel happier if i knew you \n","were wearing it. i have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the black \n","riders,' he ended in a low voice. \n","\n","'very well, i will take it,' said frodo. bilbo put it on him, and \n","fastened sting upon the glittering belt; and then frodo put over the top his \n","old weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket. \n","\n","'just a plain hobbit you look,' said bilbo. 'but there is more about \n","you now than appears on the surface. good luck to you!' he turned away and \n","looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune. \n","\n","'i cannot thank you as i should, bilbo, for this, and for all our past \n","kindnesses,' said frodo. \n","\n","'don't try!' said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the \n","back. 'ow!' he cried. 'you are too hard now to slap! but there you are: \n","hobbits must stick together, and especially bagginses. all i ask in return \n","is: take as much care of yourself as you can. and bring back all the news \n","you can, and any old songs and tales you can come by. i'll do my best to \n","finish my book before you return. i should like to write the second book, if \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","i am spared.' he broke off and turned to the window again, singing softly. \n","\n","\n","\n","i sit beside the fire and think \n","of all that i have seen, \n","of meadow-flowers and butterflies \n","in summers that have been; \n","\n","of yellow leaves and gossamer \n","in autumns that there were, \n","with morning mist and silver sun \n","and wind upon my hair. \n","\n","i sit beside the fire and think \n","of how the world will be \n","when winter comes without a spring \n","that i shall ever see. \n","\n","for still there are so many things \n","that i have never seen: \n","in every wood in every spring \n","there is a different green. \n","\n","i sit beside the fire and think \n","of people long ago, \n","and people who will see a world \n","that i shall never know. \n","\n","but all the while i sit and think \n","of times there were before, \n","\n","i listen for returning feet \n","and voices at the door. \n","\n","it was a cold grey day near the end of december. the east wind was \n","streaming through the bare branches of the trees, and seething in the dark \n","pines on the hills. ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low. as \n","the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the company made \n","ready to set out. they were to start at dusk, for elrond counselled them to \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","journey under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far \n","from ri vendell. \n","\n","'you should fear the many eyes of the servants of sauron,' he said. 'i \n","do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the riders has already reached \n","him, and he will be filled with wrath. soon now his spies on foot and wing \n","will be abroad in the northern lands. even of the sky above you must beware \n","as you go on your way.' \n","\n","the company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not \n","in battle. aragorn had andril but no other weapon, and he went forth clad \n","only in rusty green and brown, as a ranger of the wilderness. boromir had a \n","long sword, in fashion like andril but of less lineage and he bore also a \n","shield and his war -horn. \n","\n","'loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,' he said, 'and \n","then let all the foes of gondor flee!' putting it to his lips he blew a \n","blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice \n","in rivendell sprang to their feet. \n","\n","slow should you be to wind that horn again, boromir, said elrond. \n","'until you stand once more on the borders of your land, and dire need is on \n","you.' \n","\n","'maybe,' said boromir. 'but always i have let my horn cry at setting \n","forth, and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows, i will not go forth \n","as a thief in the night.' \n","\n","gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings, for \n","dwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed axe. \n","legolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a long white knife. the \n","younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but \n","frodo took only sting; and his mail-coat, as bilbo wished, remained hidden. \n","gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword glamdring, \n","the mate of orcrist that lay now upon the breast of thorin under the lonely \n","mountain. \n","\n","all were well furnished by elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had \n","jackets and cloaks lined with fur. spare food and clothes and blankets and \n","other needs were laden on a pony, none other than the poor beast that they \n","had brought from bree. \n","\n","?he stay in rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he \n","was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth. it was sam who had \n","insisted on choosing him, declaring that bill (as he called him) would pine, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","if he did not come. \n","\n","'that animal can nearly talk,' he said, 'and would talk, if he stayed \n","here much longer. he gave me a look as plain as mr. pippin could speak it: \n","if you don't let me go with you, sam, i'll follow on my own.' so bill was \n","going as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the company that \n","did not seem depressed. \n","\n","their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they \n","were only waiting now for gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. a \n","gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in \n","many windows. bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside \n","frodo. aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only elrond knew fully \n","what this hour meant to him. the others could be seen as grey shapes in the \n","darkness. \n","\n","sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily \n","into the gloom where the river roared stonily below; his desire for \n","adventure was at its lowest ebb. \n","\n","'bill, my lad,' he said, 'you oughtn't to have took up with us. you \n","could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.' bill \n","swished his tail and said nothing. \n","\n","sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his \n","mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten \n","anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt \n","that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of \n","pipe- weed (but not near enough, i'll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen \n","hose: linen; various small belongings of his master's that frodo had \n","forgotten and sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were \n","called for. he went through them all. \n","\n","'rope!' he muttered. 'no rope! and only last night you said to \n","yourself: \"sam, what about a bit of rope? you'll want it, if you haven't got \n","it:\" well, i'll want it. i can't get it now.' \n","\n","at that moment elrond came out with gandalf, and he called the company \n","to him. 'this is my last word,' he said in a low voice. 'the ring-bearer is \n","setting out on the quest of mount doom. on him alone is any charge laid: \n","neither to cast away the ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the enemy \n","nor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the company and the \n","council, and only then in gravest need. the others go with him as free \n","companions, to help him on his way. you may tarry, or come back, or turn \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","aside into other paths, as chance allows. the further you go, the less easy \n","will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further \n","than you will. for you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you \n","cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road.' \n","\n","'faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,' said gimli. \n","\n","'maybe,' said elrond, 'but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has \n","not seen the nightfall.' \n","\n","'yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,' said gimli. \n","\n","'or break it,' said elrond. 'look not too far ahead! but go now with \n","good hearts ! farewell, and may the blessing of elves and men and all free \n","folk go with you. may the stars shine upon your faces!' \n","\n","'good . . . good luck!' cried bilbo, stuttering with the cold. 'i don't \n","suppose you will be able to keep a diary, frodo my lad, but i shall expect a \n","full account when you get back. and don't be too long! farewell!' \n","\n","many others of elrond's household stood in the shadows and watched them \n","go, bidding them farewell with soft voices. there was no laughter, and no \n","song or music. at last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk. \n","\n","they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that \n","led out of the cloven vale of rivendell; and they came at length to the high \n","moor where the wind hissed through the heather. then with one glance at the \n","last flomely flouse twinkling below them they strode away far into the night. \n","\n","at the ford of bruinen they left the road and turning southwards went \n","on by narrow paths among the folded lands. their purpose was to hold this \n","course west of the mountains for many miles and days. the country was \n","much \n","\n","rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the great river in \n","wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; \n","but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. the \n","spies of sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the \n","paths were little known except to the people of rivendell. \n","\n","gandalf walked in front, and with him went aragorn, who knew this land \n","even in the dark. the others were in file behind, and legolas whose eyes \n","were keen was the rearguard. the first part of their journey was hard and \n","dreary, and frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. for many sunless \n","days an icy blast came from the mountains in the east, and no garment seemed \n","able to keep out its searching fingers. though the company was well clad, \n","they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. they slept uneasily during \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the \n","tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. in the late \n","afternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and \n","cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. in \n","the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could \n","find a way. \n","\n","at first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and \n","stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and \n","getting nowhere. each day the land looked much the same as it had the day \n","before. yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer. south of rivendell \n","they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main \n","range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys \n","filled with turbulent waters. paths were few and winding, and led them often \n","only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps. \n","\n","they had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. the wind \n","suddenly fell and then veered round to the south. the swift-flowing clouds \n","lifted and melted away, and the sun came out, pale and bright. there came a \n","cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march. the travellers \n","reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly -trees whose grey-green trunks \n","seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills. their dark \n","leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun. \n","\n","away in the south frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains \n","that seemed now to stand across the path that the company was taking. at the \n","left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up \n","like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still \n","largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed \n","red. \n","\n","gandalf stood at frodo's side and looked out under his hand. 'we have \n","done well,' he said. 'we have reached the borders of the country that men \n","call hollin; many elves lived here in happier days, when eregion was its \n","name. five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we have come, though many \n","long miles further our feet have walked. the land and the weather will be \n","milder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.' \n","\n","'dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,' said frodo, \n","throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face. \n","\n","'but the mountains are ahead of us,' said pippin. 'we must have turned \n","eastwards in the night.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'no,' said gandalf. 'but you see further ahead in the clear light. \n","\n","beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. there are many maps \n","in \n","\n","elrond's house, but i suppose you never thought to look at them?' \n","\n","'yes i did, sometimes,' said pippin, 'but i don't remember them. frodo \n","has a better head for that sort of thing.' \n","\n","'i need no map,' said gimli, who had come up with legolas, and was \n","gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes. 'there is the \n","land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those \n","mountains into many works of metal and of stone, and into many songs and \n","tales. they stand tall in our dreams: baraz, zirak, shathyr. \n","\n","'only once before have i seen them from afar in waking life, but i know \n","them and their names, for under them lies khazad-dym, the dwarrowdelf, that \n","is now called the black pit, moria in the elvish tongue. yonder stands \n","barazinbar, the redhorn, cruel caradhras; and beyond him are silvertine and \n","cloudyhead: celebdil the white, and fanuidhol the grey, that we call \n","zirak-zigil and bundushathyr. \n","\n","'there the misty mountains divide, and between their arms lies the \n","deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: azanulbizar, the dimrill dale, \n","which the elves call nanduhirion.' \n","\n","'it is for the dimrill dale that we are making,' said gandalf. 'if we \n","climb the pass that is called the redhorn gate, under the far side of \n","caradhras, we shall come down by the dimrill stair into the deep vale of the \n","dwarves. there lies the mirrormere, and there the river silverlode rises in \n","its icy springs.' \n","\n","'dark is the water of kheled-zvram,' said gimli, 'and cold are the \n","springs of kibil-nvla. my heart trembles at the thought that i may see them \n","soon.' \n","\n","'may you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf f said gandalf. 'but \n","whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. we must go down \n","the silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the great river, and then \n","\n","f \n","\n","he paused. \n","\n","'yes, and where then?' asked merry. \n","\n","'to the end of the journey - in the end,' said gandalf. 'we cannot \n","look too far ahead. let us be glad that the first stage is safely over. i \n","think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well. there is a \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","wholesome air about hollin. much evil must befall a country before it wholly \n","forgets the elves, if once they dwelt there.' \n","\n","that is true,' said legolas. 'but the elves of this land were of a \n","race strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not \n","now remember them: only i hear the stones lament them: deep they delved us, \n","fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone. they are \n","gone. they sought the elavens long ago.' \n","\n","that morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes \n","of holly, and their supper -breakfast was merrier than it had been since they \n","set out. they did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all \n","the night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again until the \n","evening of the next day. only aragorn was silent and restless. after a while \n","he left the company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the \n","shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with his head posed \n","as if he was listening. then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked \n","down at the others laughing and talking. \n","\n","'what is the matter, strider?' merry called up. 'what are you looking \n","for? do you miss the east wind?' \n","\n","'no indeed,' he answered. 'but i miss something. i have been in the \n","country of hollin in many seasons. no folk dwell here now, but many other \n","creatures live here at all times, especially birds. yet now all things but \n","you are silent. i can feel it. there is no sound for miles about us, and \n","your voices seem to make the ground echo. i do not understand it.' \n","\n","gandalf looked up with sudden interest. 'but what do you guess is the \n","reason?' he asked. 'is there more in it than surprise at seeing four \n","hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or \n","heard?' \n","\n","'i hope that is it,' answered aragorn. 'but i have a sense of \n","watchfulness, and of fear, that i have never had here before.' \n","\n","\"then we must be more careful,' said gandalf. 'if you bring a ranger \n","with you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially if the ranger is \n","aragorn. we must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.' \n","\n","it was sam's turn that day to take the first watch, but aragorn joined \n","him. the others fell asleep. then the silence grew until even sam felt it. \n","\n","the breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. the swish of the \n","pony's tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. sam \n","could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. dead silence was around \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","him, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the sun rode up from the east. \n","away in the south a dark patch appeared, and grew, and drove north like \n","flying smoke in the wind. \n","\n","'what's that, strider? it don't look like a cloud,' said sam in a \n","whisper to aragorn. he made no answer, he was gazing intently at the sky; \n","but before long sam could see for himself what was approaching. flocks of \n","birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all \n","the land as if they were searching for something; and they were steadily \n","drawing nearer. \n","\n","'lie flat and still!' hissed aragorn, pulling sam down into the shade \n","of a holly -bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from \n","the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. sam thought \n","they were a kind of crow of large size. as they passed overhead, in so dense \n","a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one \n","harsh croak was heard. \n","\n","not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the \n","sky was again clear would aragorn rise. then he sprang up and went and \n","wakened gandalf. \n","\n","'regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the \n","mountains and the greyflood,' he said, 'and they have passed over hollin. \n","they are not natives here; they are crebain out of fangorn and dunland. i do \n","not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from \n","which they are fleeing; but i think they are spying out the land. i have \n","also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. i think we ought to move \n","again this evening. hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being \n","watched.' \n","\n","'and in that case so is the redhorn gate,' said gandalf; 'and how we \n","can get over that without being seen, i cannot imagine. but we will think of \n","that when we must. as for moving as soon as it is dark, i am afraid that you \n","are right.' \n","\n","'luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the \n","crebain came,' said aragorn. 'it must be put out and not lit again.' \n","\n","'well if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!' said pippin. the news: no \n","fire, and a move again by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke \n","in the late afternoon. 'all because of a pack of crows! i had looked forward \n","to a real good meal tonight: something hot.' \n","\n","'well, you can go on looking forward,' said gandalf. 'there may be many \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","unexpected feasts ahead for you. for myself i should like a pipe to smoke in \n","comfort, and warmer feet. however, we are certain of one thing at any rate: \n","it will get warmer as we get south.' \n","\n","'too warm, i shouldn't wonder,' muttered sam to frodo. 'but i'm \n","beginning to think it's time we got a sight of that fiery mountain and saw \n","the end of the road, so to speak. i thought at first that this here redhorn, \n","or whatever its name is, might be it, till gimli spoke his piece. a fair \n","jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!' maps conveyed nothing to sam's mind, \n","and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite \n","out of his reckoning. \n","\n","all that day the company remained in hiding. the dark birds passed over \n","now and again; but as the westering sun grew red they disappeared \n","southwards. at dusk the company set out, and turning now half east they \n","steered their course towards caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly \n","red in the last light of the vanished sun. one by one white stars sprang \n","forth as the sky faded. \n","\n","guided by aragorn they struck a good path. it looked to frodo like the \n","remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from \n","hollin to the mountain-pass. the moon, now at the full, rose over the \n","mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black. \n","many of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay \n","tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land. \n","\n","it was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon \n","was low. frodo looked up at the sky. suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass \n","over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out \n","again. he shivered. \n","\n","'did you see anything pass over?' he whispered to gandalf, who was just \n","ahead. \n","\n","'no, but i felt it, whatever it was,' he answered. 'it may be nothing, \n","only a wisp of thin cloud.' \n","\n","'it was moving fast then,' muttered aragorn, 'and not with the wind.' \n","\n","nothing further happened that night. the next morning dawned even \n","brighter than before. but the air was chill again; already the wind was \n","turning back towards the east. for two more nights they marched on, climbing \n","steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the \n","mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. on the third morning caradhras rose \n","before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood. \n","\n","there was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. the wind had \n","gone now round to the north-east. gandalf snuffed the air and looked back. \n","\n","'winter deepens behind us,' he said quietly to aragorn. 'the heights \n","away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their \n","shoulders. tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the redhorn gate. \n","we may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some \n","evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. what do you \n","think of your course now, aragorn?' \n","\n","frodo overheard these words, and understood that gandalf and aragorn \n","were continuing some debate that had begun long before. he listened \n","anxiously. \n","\n","'i think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, \n","gandalf,' answered aragorn. 'and perils known and unknown will grow as we \n","go \n","\n","on. but we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the \n","mountains. further south there are no passes, till one comes to the gap of \n","rohan. i do not trust that way since your news of saruman. who knows \n","which \n","\n","side now the marshals of the horse-lords serve?' \n","\n","'who knows indeed!' said gandalf. 'but there is another way, and not by \n","the pass of caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.' \n","\n","'but let us not speak of it again! not yet. say nothing to the others i \n","beg, not until it is plain that there is no other way.' \n","\n","'we must decide before we go further,' answered gandalf. \n","\n","'then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and \n","sleep,' said aragorn. \n","\n","in the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, \n","\n","gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood looking at caradhras. its \n","sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. frodo \n","watched them, wondering which way the debate would go. when they returned \n","to \n","\n","the company gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face \n","the weather and the high pass. he was relieved. he could not guess what was \n","the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill \n","aragorn with dismay, and frodo was glad that it had been abandoned. \n","\n","'from signs that we have seen lately,' said gandalf, 'i fear that the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","redhorn gate may be watched; and also i have doubts of the weather that is \n","coming up behind. snow may come. we must go with all the speed that we \n","can. \n","\n","even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the \n","pass. dark will come early this evening. we must leave as soon as you can \n","get ready.' \n","\n","'i will add a word of advice, if i may,' said boromir. 'i was born \n","under the shadow of the white mountains and know something of journeys \n","in \n","\n","the high places. we shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down \n","on the other side. it will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen \n","to death. when we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes, \n","each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.' \n","\n","'and bill could take a bit more, couldn't you lad?' said sam. the pony \n","looked at him mournfully. \n","\n","'very well,' said gandalf. 'but we must not use the wood - not unless \n","it is a choice between fire and death.' \n","\n","the company set out again with good speed at first; but soon their way \n","became steep and difficult. the twisting and climbing road had in many \n","places almost disappeared, and was blocked with many fallen stones. the \n","night grew deadly dark under great clouds. a bitter wind swirled among the \n","rocks. by midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. the \n","narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which \n","the grim flanks of caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right \n","was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine. \n","\n","laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the \n","top. frodo felt a soft touch on his face. he put out his arm and saw the dim \n","white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve. \n","\n","they went on. but before long the snow was falling fast, filling all \n","the air, and swirling into frodo's eyes. the dark bent shapes of gandalf and \n","aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen. \n","\n","'i don't like this at all,' panted sam just behind. 'snow's all right \n","on a fine morning, but i like to be in bed while it's falling. i wish this \n","lot would go off to hobbiton! folk might welcome it there.' except on the \n","high moors of the northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the shire, and was \n","regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. no living hobbit (save \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","bilbo) could remember the fell winter of 131 1, when the white wolves \n","invaded \n","\n","the shire over the frozen brandywine. \n","\n","gandalf halted. snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was \n","already ankle-deep about his boots. \n","\n","\"this is what i feared,' he said. 'what do you say now, aragorn?' \n","\n","'that i feared it too,' aragorn answered, 'but less than other things. \n","\n","i knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save \n","high up in the mountains. but we are not high yet; we are still far down, \n","where the paths are usually open all the winter.' \n","\n","'i wonder if this is a contrivance of the enemy,' said boromir. \"they \n","say in my land that he can govern the storms in the mountains of shadow that \n","stand upon the borders of mordor. he has strange powers and many allies.' \n","\n","'his arm has grown long indeed,' said gimli, 'if he can draw snow down \n","from the north to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.' \n","\n","'his arm has grown long,' said gandalf. \n","\n","while they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened \n","until it almost ceased. they tramped on again. but they had not gone more \n","than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury. the wind whistled \n","and the snow became a blinding blizzard. soon even boromir found it hard to \n","keep going. the hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller \n","folk, but it was plain that they could not go much further, if the snow \n","continued. frodo's feet felt like lead. pippin was dragging behind. even \n","gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged. \n","\n","the company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement \n","without any words being spoken. they heard eerie noises in the darkness \n","round them. it may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and \n","gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and \n","wild howls of laughter. stones began to fall from the mountain-side, \n","whistling over their heads, or crashing on the path beside them. every now \n","and again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from \n","hidden heights above. \n","\n","'we cannot go further tonight,' said boromir. 'let those call it the \n","wind who will; there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are aimed \n","at us.' \n","\n","'i do call it the wind,' said aragorn. 'but that does not make what you \n","say untrue. there are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","little love for those that go on two legs, and yet are not in league with \n","sauron, but have purposes of their own. some have been in this world longer \n","than he.' \n","\n","'caradhras was called the cruel, and had an ill name, said gimli, 'long \n","years ago, when rumour of sauron had not been heard in these lands.' \n","\n","'it matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; \n","said gandalf. \n","\n","'but what can we do?' cried pippin miserably. he was leaning on merry \n","and frodo, and he was shivering. \n","\n","'either stop where we are, or go back,' said gandalf. 'it is no good \n","going on. only a little higher, if i remember rightly, this path leaves the \n","cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard \n","slope. we should have no shelter there from snow, or stones - or anything \n","else.' \n","\n","'and it is no good going back while the storm holds,' said aragorn. 'we \n","have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this \n","cliff-wall we are under now.' \n","\n","'shelter!' muttered sam. 'if this is shelter, then one wall and no roof \n","make a house.' \n","\n","the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. \n","\n","it faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that \n","they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and \n","from the falling stones. but eddying blasts swirled round them from every \n","side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds. \n","\n","they huddled together with their backs to the wall. bill the pony stood \n","patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a \n","little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went \n","on mounting. if they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon \n","have been entirely buried. \n","\n","a great sleepiness came over frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a \n","warm and hazy dream. he thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the \n","shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard bilbo's voice speaking. / \n","don 't think much of your diary , he said. snowstorms on january the twelfth: \n","there was no need to come back to report that! \n","\n","but i wanted rest and sleep, bilbo , frodo answered with an effort, when \n","he felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. boromir \n","had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'this will be the death of the halflings, gandalf,' said boromir. 'it \n","is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads. we must do \n","something to save ourselves.' \n","\n","'give them this,' said gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a \n","leathern flask. 'just a mouthful each - for all of us. it is very precious. \n","\n","it is miruvor, the cordial of imladris. elrond gave it to me at our parting. \n","\n","pass it round!' \n","\n","as soon as frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor \n","he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs. \n","\n","the others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour. but the snow did \n","not relent. it whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew \n","louder. \n","\n","'what do you say to fire?' asked boromir suddenly. 'the choice seems \n","near now between fire and death, gandalf. doubtless we shall be hidden from \n","all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help \n","us.' \n","\n","'you may make a fire, if you can,' answered gandalf. 'if there are any \n","watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.' but \n","though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of boromir, it \n","passed the skill of elf or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid \n","the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. at last reluctantly gandalf \n","himself took a hand. picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and \n","then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen ! he thrust the end of his \n","staff into the midst of it. at once a great spout of green and blue flame \n","sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered. \n","\n","'if there are any to see, then i at least am revealed to them,' he \n","said. 'i have written gandalf is here in signs that all can read from \n","rivendell to the mouths of anduin.' \n","\n","but the company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes. their \n","hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire. the wood burned merrily; \n","and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under \n","their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. there they stood, \n","stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames. a red \n","light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a \n","black wall. \n","\n","but the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell. \n","\n","the fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the night is getting old,' said aragorn. \"the dawn is not far off.' \n","\n","'if any dawn can pierce these clouds,' said gimli. \n","\n","boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness. \n","\n","'the snow is growing less,' he said, 'and the wind is quieter.' \n","\n","frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be \n","revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long \n","time he could see no sign of their slackening. then suddenly, as sleep was \n","beginning to creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed \n","fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer. very slowly a dim \n","light began to grow. at last the snow stopped altogether. \n","\n","as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. below \n","their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which \n","the path that they had trodden was altogether lost; but the heights above \n","were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow. \n","\n","gimli looked up and shook his head. 'caradhras has not forgiven us.' he \n","said. 'he has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. the sooner we go \n","back and down the better.' \n","\n","to this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. it might well \n","prove impossible. only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay \n","many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been \n","scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff. \n","\n","'if gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a \n","path for you,' said legolas. the storm had troubled him little, and he alone \n","of the company remained still light of heart. \n","\n","'if elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the sun to save \n","us,' answered gandalf. 'but i must have something to work on. i cannot burn \n","snow.' \n","\n","'well,' said boromir, 'when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as \n","we say in my country. the strongest of us must seek a way. see! though all \n","is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of \n","rock down yonder. it was there that the snow first began to burden us. if we \n","could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. it is no more \n","than a furlong off, i guess.' \n","\n","'then let us force a path thither, you and i!' said aragorn. \n","\n","aragorn was the tallest of the company, but boromir, little less in \n","height, was broader and heavier in build. he led the way, and aragorn \n","followed him. slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","places the snow was breast-high, and often boromir seemed to be swimming \n","or \n","\n","burrowing with his great arms rather than walking. \n","\n","legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then \n","he turned to the others. 'the strongest must seek a way, say you? but i say: \n","let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running \n","light over grass and leaf or over snow-an elf.' \n","\n","with that he sprang forth nimbly, and then frodo noticed as if for the \n","first time, though he had long known it, that the elf had no boots, but wore \n","only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the \n","snow. \n","\n","'farewell!' he said to gandalf. 'i go to find the sun!' then swift as a \n","runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, \n","with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and \n","vanished round the rocky turn. \n","\n","the others waited huddled together, watching until boromir and aragorn \n","dwindled into black specks in the whiteness. at length they too passed from \n","sight. the time dragged on. the clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow \n","came curling down again. \n","\n","an hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last \n","they saw legolas coming back. at the same time boromir and aragorn \n","reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope. \n","\n","'well,' cried legolas as he ran up, 'i have not brought the sun. she is \n","walking in the blue fields of the south, and a little wreath of snow on this \n","redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. but i have brought back a gleam of \n","good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet. there is the greatest \n","wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our strong men were almost \n","buried. they despaired, until i returned and told them that the drift was \n","little wider than a wall. and on the other side the snow suddenly grows \n","less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a \n","hobbit's toes.' \n","\n","'ah, it is as i said,' growled gimli. 'it was no ordinary storm. it is \n","the ill will of caradhras. he does not love elves and dwarves, and that \n","drift was laid to cut off our escape.' \n","\n","'but happily your caradhras has forgotten that you have men with you,' \n","said boromir, who came up at that moment. 'and doughty men too, if i may \n","say \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","it; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. still, we \n","have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may be grateful \n","who cannot run as light as elves.' \n","\n","'but how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the \n","drift?' said pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits. \n","\n","'have hope!' said boromir. 'i am weary, but i still have some strength \n","left, and aragorn too. we will bear the little folk. the others no doubt \n","will make shift to tread the path behind us. come, master peregrin! i will \n","begin with you.' \n","\n","he lifted up the hobbit. 'cling to my back! i shall need my arms' he \n","said and strode forward. aragorn with merry came behind. pippin marvelled at \n","his strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other \n","tool than his great limbs. even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the \n","track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went. \n","\n","they came at length to the great drift. it was flung across the \n","mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if \n","shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of boromir; but \n","through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a \n","bridge. on the far side merry and pippin were set down, and there they \n","waited with legolas for the rest of the company to arrive. \n","\n","after a while boromir returned carrying sam. behind in the narrow but \n","now well-trodden track came gandalf, leading bill with gimli perched among \n","the baggage. last came aragorn carrying frodo. they passed through the lane; \n","but hardly had frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled \n","down a fall of stones and slithering snow. the spray of it half blinded the \n","company as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again \n","they saw that the path was blocked behind them. \n","\n","'enough, enough!' cried gimli. 'we are departing as quickly as we may!' \n","and indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be \n","expended, as if caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten \n","off and would not dare to return. the threat of snow lifted; the clouds \n","began to break and the light grew broader. \n","\n","as legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more \n","shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. soon \n","they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope \n","where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before. \n","\n","the morning was now far advanced. from the high place they looked back \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","westwards over the lower lands. far away in the tumble of country that lay \n","at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to \n","climb the pass. \n","\n","frodo's legs ached. he was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head \n","was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill. black specks \n","swam before his eyes. he rubbed them, but the black specks remained. in the \n","distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were \n","circling in the air. \n","\n","'the birds again!' said aragorn, pointing down. \n","\n","that cannot be helped now,' said gandalf. 'whether they are good or \n","evil, or have nothing to do with us at all, we must go down at once. not \n","even on the knees of caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!' \n","\n","a cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the \n","redhorn gate, and stumbled wearily down the slope. caradhras had defeated \n","them. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 4 . a journey in the dark \n","\n","\n","\n","it was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they \n","halted for the night. they were very weary. the mountains were veiled in \n","deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. gandalf spared them one more \n","mouthful \n","\n","each of the miruvor of rivendell. when they had eaten some food he called a \n","council. \n","\n","'we cannot, of course, go on again tonight,' he said. 'the attack on \n","the redhorn gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.' \n","\n","'and then where are we to go? ' asked frodo. \n","\n","'we still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered gandalf. \n","\n","'we have no choice but to go on, or to return to rivendell.' \n","\n","pippin's face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to \n","rivendell; merry and sam looked up hopefully. but aragorn and boromir \n","made \n","\n","no sign. frodo looked troubled. \n","\n","'i wish i was back there,' he said. 'but how can i return without shame \n","- unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? ' \n","\n","'you are right, frodo,' said gandalf: 'to go back is to admit defeat \n","and face worse defeat to come. if we go back now, then the ring must remain \n","there: we shall not be able to set out again. then sooner or later rivendell \n","will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. \n","\n","the ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the \n","power and terror they would possess if the ruling ring was on their master's \n","hand again.' \n","\n","'then we must go on, if there is a way,' said frodo with a sigh. sam \n","sank back into gloom. \n","\n","'there is a way that we may attempt,' said gandalf. i thought from the \n","beginning, when first i considered this journey, that we should try it. but \n","it is not a pleasant way, and i have not spoken of it to the company before. \n","aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been \n","tried.' \n","\n","'if it is a worse road than the redhorn gate, then it must be evil \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","indeed,' said merry. 'but you had better tell us about it, and let us know \n","the worst at once.' \n","\n","'the road that i speak of leads to the mines of moria,' said gandalf. \n","\n","only gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. on all \n","the others a dread fell at the mention of that name. even to the hobbits it \n","was a legend of vague fear: \n","\n","'the road may lead to moria, but how can we hope that it will lead \n","through moria? ' said aragorn darkly. \n","\n","'it is a name of ill omen,' said boromir. 'nor do i see the need to go \n","there. if we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we \n","come to the gap of rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the \n","road that i followed on my way hither. or we might pass by and cross the \n","isen into langstrand and lebennin, and so come to gondor from the regions \n","nigh to the sea.' \n","\n","'things have changed since you came north, boromir,' answered gandalf. \n","'did you not hear what i told you of saruman? with him i may have business \n","of my own ere all is over. but the ring must not come near isengard, if that \n","can by any means be prevented. the gap of rohan is closed to us while we go \n","with the bearer. \n","\n","'as for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. we might spend a \n","year in such a journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty \n","and harbourless. yet they would not be safe. the watchful eyes both of \n","saruman and of the enemy are on them. when you came north, boromir, you \n","were \n","\n","in the enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a matter of \n","small concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the ring. but \n","you return now as a member of the ring's company, and you are in peril as \n","long as you remain with us. the danger will increase with every league that \n","we go south under the naked sky. \n","\n","'since our open attempt on the mountain -pass our plight has become more \n","desperate, i fear. i see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from \n","sight for a while, and cover our trail. therefore i advise that we should go \n","neither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them. that is a road \n","at any rate that the enemy will least expect us to take.' \n","\n","'we do not know what he expects,' said boromir. 'lie may watch all \n","roads, likely and unlikely. in that case to enter moria would be to walk \n","into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the dark tower \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","itself. the name of moria is black.' \n","\n","'you speak of what you do not know, when you liken moria to the \n","stronghold of sauron,' answered gandalf. 'i alone of you have ever been in \n","the dungeons of the dark lord, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in \n","dol guldur. those who pass the gates of barad-dyr do not return. but i would \n","not lead you into moria if there were no hope of coming out again. if there \n","are ores there, it may prove ill for us, that is true. but most of the ores \n","of the misty mountains were scattered or destroyed in the battle of five \n","armies. the eagles report that ores are gathering again from afar; but there \n","is a hope that moria is still free. \n","\n","'there is even a chance that dwarves are there, and that in some deep \n","hall of his fathers, balin son of fundin may be found. however it may prove, \n","one must tread the path that need chooses!' \n","\n","'i will tread the path with you, gandalf! ' said gimli. 'i will go and \n","look on the halls of durin, whatever may wait there-if you can find the \n","doors that are shut.' \n","\n","'good, gimli! ' said gandalf. 'you encourage me. we will seek the \n","hidden doors together. and we will come through. in the ruins of the \n","dwarves, a dwarfs head will be less easy to bewilder than elves or men or \n","hobbits. yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria. i \n","sought there long for thrbin son of thrur after he was lost. i passed \n","through, and i came out again alive! ' \n","\n","'i too once passed the dimrill gate,' said aragorn quietly; 'but though \n","i also came out again, the memory is very evil. i do not wish to enter moria \n","a second time.' \n","\n","'and i don't wish to enter it even once,' said pippin. \n","\n","'nor me,' muttered sam. \n","\n","'of course not! ' said gandalf. 'who would? but the question is: who \n","will follow me, if i lead you there? ' \n","\n","'i will,' said gimli eagerly. \n","\n","'i will,' said aragorn heavily. 'you followed my lead almost to \n","disaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. i will follow your \n","lead now - if this last warning does not move you. it is not of the ring, \n","nor of us others that i am thinking now, but of you, gandalf. and i say to \n","you: if you pass the doors of moria, beware! ' \n","\n","'i will not go,' said boromir; 'not unless the vote of the whole \n","company is against me. what do legolas and the little folk say? the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","ring-bearer's voice surely should be heard? ' \n","\n","i do not wish to go to moria,' said legolas. \n","\n","the hobbits said nothing. sam looked at frodo. at last frodo spoke. 'i \n","do not wish to go,' he said; 'but neither do i wish to refuse the advice of \n","gandalf. i beg that there should be no vote, until we have slept on it. \n","gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this cold \n","gloom. how the wind howls ! ' \n","\n","at these words all fell into silent thought. they heard the wind \n","hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round \n","them in the empty spaces of the night. \n","\n","suddenly aragorn leapt to his feet. 'how the wind howls ! ' he cried. \n","\n","'it is howling with wolf-voices. the wargs have come west of the mountains! \n","\n","f \n","\n","'need we wait until morning then? ' said gandalf. 'it is as i said. the \n","hunt is up! even if we live to see the dawn, who now will wish to journey \n","south by night with the wild wolves on his trail? ' \n","\n","'how far is moria? ' asked boromir. \n","\n","'there was a door south-west of caradhras, some fifteen miles as the \n","crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered gandalf grimly. \n","\n","'then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,' said \n","boromir. 'the wolf that one hears is worse than the ore that one fears.' \n","\n","'true!' said aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. 'but where the \n","warg howls, there also the ore prowls.' \n","\n","'i wish i had taken elrond's advice,' muttered pippin to sam. i am no \n","good after all. there is not enough of the breed of bandobras the bullroarer \n","in me: these howls freeze my blood. i don't ever remember feeling so \n","wretched.' \n","\n","'my heart's right down in my toes, mr. pippin,' said sam. 'but we \n","aren't etten yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. whatever may \n","be in store for old gandalf, i'll wager it isn't a wolfs belly.' \n","\n","for their defence in the night the company climbed to the top of the \n","small hill under which they had been sheltering, it was crowned with a knot \n","of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones. \n","\n","in the midst of this they lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness \n","and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs. \n","\n","round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed \n","uneasily. poor bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood. the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and \n","sometimes \n","\n","further off. in the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering \n","over the brow of the hill. some advanced almost to the ring of stones. at a \n","gap in the circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at \n","them. a shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning \n","his pack to the assault. \n","\n","gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. 'listen, \n","\n","hound of sauron! ' he cried. 'gandalf is here. fly, if you value your foul \n","skin! i will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.' \n","\n","the wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. at that \n","moment there was a sharp twang. legolas had loosed his bow. there was a \n","hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the ground; the elvish arrow \n","had pierced its throat. the watching eyes were suddenly extinguished. \n","gandalf and aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting \n","packs had fled. all about them the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on \n","the sighing wind. \n","\n","the night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting, gleaming \n","fitfully through the breaking clouds. suddenly frodo started from sleep. \n","without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the \n","camp. a great host of wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them \n","from every side at once. \n","\n","'fling fuel on the fire!' cried gandalf to the hobbits. 'draw your \n","blades, and stand back to back!' \n","\n","in the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, frodo saw many grey \n","shapes spring over the ring of stones. more and more followed. through the \n","throat of one huge leader aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a \n","great sweep boromir hewed the head off another. beside them gimli stood \n","with \n","\n","his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. the bow of legolas was \n","singing. \n","\n","in the wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, \n","a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set \n","upon a hill. stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to \n","meet the wolves. they gave back before him. high in the air he tossed the \n","blazing brand. it flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and \n","his voice rolled like thunder. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","' naur an edraith ammen! naur dan i ngaurhoth!' he cried. \n","\n","there was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into a \n","leaf and bloom of blinding flame. the fire leapt from tree-top to tree -top. \n","\n","the whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. the swords and knives of the \n","defenders shone and flickered. the last arrow of legolas kindled in the air \n","as it flew, and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain. \n","\n","all the others fled. \n","\n","slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks; \n","a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the \n","hill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky. their enemies were \n","routed and did not return. \n","\n","'what did i tell you, mr. pippin? ' said sam, she/thing his sword. \n","\n","'wolves won't get him. that was an eye-opener, and no mistake! nearly singed \n","the hair off my head!' \n","\n","when the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to \n","be found, and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead. no trace of \n","the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of legolas lying on \n","the hill-top. all were undamaged save one of which only the point was left. \n","\n","'it is as i feared,' said gandalf. 'these were no ordinary wolves \n","hunting for food in the wilderness. let us eat quickly and go!' \n","\n","that day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command \n","of some power that had no longer any use for snow, since they had retreated \n","from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things \n","that moved in the wild could be seen from far away. the wind had been \n","turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. the \n","clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue. as they \n","stood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the \n","mountain-tops. \n","\n","'we must reach the doors before sunset,' said gandalf, 'or i fear we \n","shall not reach them at all. it is not far, but our path may be winding, for \n","here aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only \n","once have i been under the west wall of moria, and that was long ago. \n","\n","'there it lies,' he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the \n","mountains' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet. in the distance \n","could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst, taller than \n","the rest, one great grey wall. 'when we left the pass i led you southwards, \n","and not back to our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. it is \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","well that i did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and haste \n","is needed. let us go! ' \n","\n","'i do not know which to hope,' said boromir grimly: 'that gandalf will \n","find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost \n","for ever. all choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall \n","the likeliest chance. lead on!' \n","\n","gimli now walked ahead by the wizard's side, so eager was he to come to \n","moria. together they led the company back towards the mountains. the only \n","road of old to moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream, \n","the sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors \n","had stood. but either gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in \n","recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, \n","only a few miles southwards from their start. \n","\n","the morning was passing towards noon, and still the company wandered \n","and scrambled in a barren country of red stones. nowhere could they see any \n","gleam of water or hear any sound of it. all was bleak and dry. their hearts \n","sank. they saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the \n","night would bring, if it caught them in that lost land, none of them cared \n","to think. \n","\n","suddenly gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. he was \n","standing on a knoll and pointing to the right. hurrying up they saw below \n","them a deep and narrow channel. it was empty and silent, and hardly a \n","trickle of water flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed; \n","but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound \n","its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad. \n","\n","'ah! here it is at last! ' said gandalf. 'this is where the stream ran: \n","\n","sirannon, the gate-stream, they used to call it. but what has happened to \n","the water, i cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy. come! we must \n","hurry on. we are late.' \n","\n","the company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along \n","the rough and winding track for many miles. the sun turned from the noon and \n","began to go west. after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again. \n","before them the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough of \n","land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward \n","peaks. \n","\n","at length they came to a sharp bend. there the road, which had been \n","veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","land to the left, turned and went due east again. rounding the corner they \n","saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and \n","jagged top. over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that \n","seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full. \n","\n","'indeed things have changed! ' said gandalf. 'but there is no mistaking \n","the place. there is all that remains of the stair falls. if i remember \n","right, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the \n","main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level \n","ground at the top. there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right \n","up to the walls of moria, and the sirannon flowed through it with the road \n","beside it. let us go and see what things are like now ! ' \n","\n","they found the stone steps without difficulty, and gimli sprang swiftly \n","up them, followed by gandalf and frodo. when they reached the top they saw \n","that they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of \n","the gate-stream was revealed. behind them the sinking sun filled the cool \n","western sky with glimmering gold. before them stretched a dark still lake. \n","neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. the sirannon had \n","been dammed and had filled all the valley. beyond the ominous water were \n","reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and \n","impassable. no sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could frodo \n","see in the frowning stone. \n","\n","'there are the walls of moria,' said gandalf, pointing across the \n","water. 'and there the gate stood once upon a time, the elven door at the end \n","of the road from flollin by which we have come. but this way is blocked. none \n","of the company, i guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of \n","the day. it has an unwholesome look.' \n","\n","'we must find a way round the northern edge,' said gimli. 'the first \n","thing for the company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where \n","that will lead us. even if there were no lake, we could not get our \n","baggage-pony up this stair.' \n","\n","'but in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the mines,' said \n","gandalf. 'the road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are places \n","narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.' \n","\n","'poor old bill! ' said frodo. 'i had not thought of that. and poor sam! \n","\n","i wonder what he will say? ' \n","\n","'i am sorry,' said gandalf. 'poor bill has been a useful companion and \n","it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now. i would have travelled lighter \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and brought no animal, least of all this one that sam is fond of, if i had \n","had my way. i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.' \n","\n","the day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky \n","high above the sunset, when the company, with all the speed they could, \n","climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. in breadth it looked \n","to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point. how far it \n","stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its \n","northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between \n","the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a \n","rim of open ground. they hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two \n","to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that gandalf was \n","making for; and then he had still to find the doors. \n","\n","when they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a \n","narrow creek that barred their way. it was green and stagnant, thrust out \n","like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. gimli strode forward \n","undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at \n","the edge. behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for \n","under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was \n","treacherous. frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean \n","water on his feet. \n","\n","as sam, the last of the company, led bill up on to the dry ground on \n","the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a \n","fish had disturbed the still surface of the water. turning quickly they saw \n","ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were \n","widening outwards from a point far out in the lake. there was a bubbling \n","noise, and then silence. the dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the \n","sunset were veiled in cloud. \n","\n","gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as \n","quickly as they could. they reached the strip of dry land between the lake \n","and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and \n","encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the \n","cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. a mile \n","southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees. stumps and dead \n","boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets, \n","or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. but \n","close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, . two tall \n","trees, larger than any trees of holly that frodo had ever seen or imagined. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","their great roots spread from the wall to the water. under the looming \n","cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of \n","the stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing \n","deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the \n","end of the road. \n","\n","'well, here we are at last! 'said gandalf. 'here the elven-way from \n","hollin ended. holly was the token of the people of that land, and they \n","planted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the west -door was made \n","chiefly for their use in their traffic with the lords of moria. those were \n","happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of \n","different race, even between dwarves and elves.' \n","\n","'it was not the fault of the dwarves that the friendship waned,' said \n","gimli. \n","\n","'i have not heard that it was the fault of the elves,' said legolas. \n","\n","'i have heard both,' said gandalf; 'and i will not give judgement now. \n","\n","but i beg you two, legolas and gimli, at least to be friends, and to help \n","me. i need you both. the doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find \n","them the better. night is at hand! ' \n","\n","turning to the others he said: 'while i am searching, will you each \n","make ready to enter the mines? for here i fear we must say farewell to our \n","good beast of burden. you must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought \n","against bitter weather: you will not need it inside, nor, i hope, when we \n","come through and journey on down into the south. instead each of us must \n","take a share of what the pony carried, especially the food and the \n","water-skins.' \n","\n","'but you can't leave poor old bill behind in this forsaken place, mr. \n","gandalf! ' cried sam, angry and distressed. 'i won't have it, and that's \n","flat. after he has come so far and all ! ' \n","\n","'i am sorry, sam,' said the wizard. 'but when the door opens i do not \n","think you will be able to drag your bill inside, into the long dark of \n","moria. you will have to choose between bill and your master.' \n","\n","'he'd follow mr. frodo into a dragon's den, if i led him,' protested \n","sam. 'it'd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these \n","wolves about.' \n","\n","'it will be short of murder, i hope,' said gandalf. he laid his hand on \n","the pony's head, and spoke in a low voice. 'go with words of guard and \n","guiding on you,' he said. 'you are a wise beast, and have learned much in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","rivendell. make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in \n","time to elrond's house, or wherever you wish to go. \n","\n","'there, sam! he will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and \n","getting home as we have.' \n","\n","sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. bill, seeming to \n","understand well what was going on, nuzzled up to him, putting his nose to \n","sam's ear. sam burst into tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all \n","the pony's packs and throwing them on the ground. the others sorted out the \n","goods, making a pile of all that could be left behind, and dividing up the \n","rest. \n","\n","when this was done they turned to watch gandalf. he appeared to have \n","done nothing. he was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall \n","of the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes. gimli was \n","wandering about, tapping the stone here and there with his axe. legolas was \n","pressed against the rock, as if listening. \n","\n","'well, here we are and all ready,' said merry; 'but where are the \n","doors? i can't see any sign of them.' \n","\n","'dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,' said gimli. 'they are \n","invisible, and their own masters cannot find them or open them, if their \n","secret is forgotten.' \n","\n","'but this door was not made to be a secret known only to dwarves,' said \n","gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round. 'unless things are \n","altogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.' \n","\n","he walked forward to the wall. right between the shadow of the trees \n","there was a smooth space, and over this he passed his hands to and fro, \n","muttering words under his breath. then he stepped back. \n","\n","'look!' he said. 'can you see anything now?' \n","\n","the moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see \n","nothing else for a while. then slowly on the surface, where the wizard's \n","hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running \n","in the stone. at first they were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine \n","that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon caught them, but steadily \n","they grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed. \n","\n","at the top, as high as gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing \n","letters in an elvish character. below, though the threads were in places \n","blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","surmounted by a crown with seven stars. beneath these again were two trees, \n","each bearing crescent moons. more clearly than all else there shone forth in \n","the middle of the door a single star with many rays. \n","\n","'there are the emblems of dunn!' cried gimli. \n","\n","'and there is the tree of the high elves!' said legolas. \n","\n","'and the star of the house of flanor,' said gandalf. 'they are wrought \n","of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it \n","is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in middle-earth. it is \n","long since i heard them, and i thought deeply before i could recall them to \n","my mind.' \n","\n","'what does the writing say?' asked frodo, who was trying to decipher \n","the inscription on the arch. 'i thought i knew the elf-letters but i cannot \n","read these.' \n","\n","'the words are in the elven-tongue of the west of middle-earth in the \n","elder days,' answered gandalf. 'but they do not say anything of importance \n","to us. they say only: the doors ofdurin, lord ofmoria. speak, friend, and \n","enter. and underneath small and faint is written: i, narvi, made them. \n","celebrimbor ofhollin drew these signs.' \n","\n","'what does it mean by speak, friend, and enter!' asked merry. \n","\n","'that is plain enough,' said gimli. 'if you are a friend, speak the \n","password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.' \n","\n","'yes,' said gandalf, 'these doors are probably governed by words. some \n","dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for particular persons; and \n","some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and \n","words are known. these doors have no key. in the days of durin they were not \n","secret. they usually stood open and doorwards sat here. but if they were \n","shut, any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. at least so \n","it is recorded, is it not, gimli? ' \n","\n","'it is,' said the dwarf. 'but what the word was is not remembered. \n","\n","narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.' \n","\n","'but do not you know the word, gandalf? ' asked boromir in surprise. \n","\n","'no! ' said the wizard. \n","\n","the others looked dismayed; only aragorn, who knew gandalf well, \n","remained silent and unmoved. \n","\n","'then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?' cried \n","boromir, glancing back with a shudder at the dark water. 'you told us that \n","you had once passed through the mines. how could that be, if you did not \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","know how to enter? ' \n","\n","'the answer to your first question, boromir,' said the wizard, 'is that \n","i do not know the word-yet. but we shall soon see. and,' he added, with a \n","glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, 'you may ask what is the use \n","of my deeds when they are proved useless. as for your other question: do you \n","doubt my tale? or have you no wits left? i did not enter this way. i came \n","from the east. \n","\n","'if you wish to know, i will tell you that these doors open outwards. \n","\n","from the inside you may thrust them open with your hands. from the outside \n","nothing will move them save the spell of command. they cannot be forced \n","inwards.' \n","\n","'what are you going to do then? ' asked pippin, undaunted by the \n","wizard's bristling brows. \n","\n","'knock on the doors with your head, peregrin took,' said gandalf. 'but \n","if that does not shatter them, and i am allowed a little peace from foolish \n","questions, i will seek for the opening words. \n","\n","'i once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves or men or ores \n","that was ever used for such a purpose. i can still remember ten score of \n","them without searching in my mind. but only a few trials, i think, will be \n","needed; and i shall not have to call on gimli for words of the secret \n","dwarf-tongue that they teach to none. the opening words were elvish, like \n","the writing on the arch: that seems certain.' \n","\n","ele stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the \n","silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil. \n","\n","annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! \n","\n","fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen! \n","\n","he said in a commanding voice. the silver lines faded, but the blank \n","grey stone did not stir. \n","\n","many times he repeated these words in different order, or varied them. \n","then he tried other spells, one after another, speaking now faster and \n","louder, now soft and slow. then he spoke many single words of elvish speech. \n","nothing happened. the cliff towered into the night, the countless stars were \n","kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast. \n","\n","again gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in \n","tones of command and rising wrath. edro, edro! he cried, and struck the rock \n","with his staff. open, open! he shouted, and followed it with the same \n","command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","middle-earth. then he threw his staff on the ground, and sat down in \n","silence. \n","\n","at that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the \n","howling of wolves. bill the pony started in fear, and sam sprang to his side \n","and whispered softly to him. \n","\n","'do not let him run away! ' said boromir. 'it seems that we shall need \n","him still, if the wolves do not find us. how i hate this foul pool! ' he \n","stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water. \n","\n","the stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant there was \n","a swish and a bubble. great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond \n","where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards the foot of the \n","cliff. \n","\n","'why did you do that, boromir? ' said frodo. v i hate this place, too, \n","and i am afraid. i don't know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the \n","doors, but of something else. i am afraid of the pool. don't disturb it! ' \n","\n","'1 wish we could get away! ' said merry. \n","\n","'why doesn't gandalf do something quick? ' said pippin. \n","\n","gandalf took no notice of them. he sat with his head bowed, either in \n","despair or in anxious thought. the mournful howling of the wolves was heard \n","again. the ripples on the water grew and came closer; some were already \n","lapping on the shore. \n","\n","with a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. \n","\n","he was laughing! v i have it! ' he cried. 'of course, of course! absurdly \n","simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.' \n","\n","picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear \n","voice: mellon! \n","\n","the star shone out briefly and faded again. then silently a great \n","doorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had been visible before. \n","slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch, until both \n","doors lay back against the wall. through the opening a shadowy stair could \n","be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was \n","deeper than the night. the company stared in wonder. \n","\n","v i was wrong after all,' said gandalf, 'and gimli too. merry, of all \n","people, was on the right track. the opening word was inscribed on the \n","archway all the time! the translation should have been: say \"friend\" and \n","enter. i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened. \n","quite simple. too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","those were happier times. now let us go!' \n","\n","he strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. but at that \n","moment several things happened. frodo felt something seize him by the ankle, \n","and he fell with a cry. bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned \n","tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. sam leaped after \n","him, and then hearing frodo's cry he ran back again, weeping and cursing. \n","the others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host \n","of snakes were swimming up from the southern end. \n","\n","out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was \n","pale-green and luminous and wet. its fingered end had hold of frodo's foot \n","and was dragging him into the water. sam on his knees was now slashing at it \n","with a knife. \n","\n","the arm let go of frodo, and sam pulled him away, crying out for help. \n","twenty others arms came rippling out. the dark water boiled, and there was a \n","hideous stench. \n","\n","'into the gateway! up the stairs! quick! ' shouted gandalf leaping \n","back. rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but sam to \n","the ground where they stood, he drove them forward. \n","\n","they were just in time. sam and frodo were only a few steps up, and \n","gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across \n","the narrow shore and fingered the cliff- wall and the doors. one came \n","wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight. gandalf turned \n","and paused. if he was considering what word would close the gate again from \n","within, there was no need. many coiling arms seized the doors on either \n","side, and with horrible strength, swung them round. with a shattering echo \n","they slammed, and all light was lost. a noise of rending and crashing came \n","dully through the ponderous stone. \n","\n","sam, clinging to frodo's arm, collapsed on a step in the black \n","darkness. 'poor old bill! ' he said in a choking voice. 'poor old bill! \n","wolves and snakes! but the snakes were too much for him. i had to choose, \n","mr. frodo. i had to come with you.' \n","\n","they heard gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against \n","the doors. there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the \n","doors did not open. 'well, well! ' said the wizard. 'the passage is blocked \n","behind us now and there is only one way out- on the other side of the \n","mountains. i fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the \n","trees uprooted and thrown across the gate. i am sorry; for the trees were \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","beautiful, and had stood so long.' \n","\n","'i felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot \n","first touched the water,' said frodo. 'what was the thing, or were there \n","many of them? ' \n","\n","'i do not know,' answered gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one \n","purpose. something has crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under \n","the mountains. there are older and fouler things than ores in the deep \n","places of the world.' he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it \n","was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on frodo first among all the \n","company. \n","\n","boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the \n","sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: 'in the deep places of the \n","world! and thither we are going against my wish. who will lead us nowin \n","this deadly dark? ' \n","\n","'i will,' said gandalf, 'and gimli shall walk with me. follow my staff! \n","\n","t \n","\n","as the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff \n","aloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance. the wide stairway was \n","sound and undamaged. two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow; \n","and \n","\n","at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into \n","the dark. \n","\n","'let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, \n","since we can't find a dining-room! ' said frodo. he had begun to shake off \n","the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry. \n","\n","the proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, \n","dim figures in the gloom. after they had eaten, gandalf gave them each a \n","third sip of the miruvor of rivendell. \n","\n","'it will not last much longer, i am afraid,' he said; 'but i think we \n","need it after that horror at the gate. and unless we have great luck, we \n","shall need all that is left before we see the other side! go carefully with \n","the water, too! there are many streams and wells in the mines, but they \n","should not be touched. we may not have a chance of filling our skins and \n","bottles till we come down into dimrill dale.' \n","\n","'how long is that going to take us? ' asked frodo. \n","\n","'i cannot say,' answered gandalf. 'it depends on many chances. but \n","going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","four marches, i expect. it cannot be less than forty miles from west -door to \n","east-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.' \n","\n","after only a brief rest they started on their way again. all were eager \n","to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as \n","they were, to go on marching still for several hours. gandalf walked in \n","front as before. in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light \n","of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his \n","sword glamdring. behind him came gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light \n","as he turned his head from side to side. behind the dwarf walked frodo, and \n","he had drawn the short sword, sting. no gleam came from the blades of sting \n","or of glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of elvish \n","smiths in the elder days these swords shone with a cold light, if any ores \n","were near at hand. behind frodo went sam, and after him legolas, and the \n","young hobbits, and boromir. in the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked \n","aragorn. \n","\n","the passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. it \n","went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again. the \n","air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt \n","currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings \n","in the walls. there were many of these. in the pale ray of the wizard's \n","staff, frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and \n","tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on \n","either side. it was bewildering beyond hope of remembering. \n","\n","gimli aided gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. at least \n","he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in \n","itself. often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was \n","doubtful; but it was always gandalf who had the final word. the mines of \n","moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of gimli, gluin's son, \n","dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. to gandalf the far-off memories of \n","a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and \n","despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did \n","not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal. \n","\n","'do not be afraid! ' said aragorn. there was a pause longer than usual, \n","and gandalf and gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded \n","behind, waiting anxiously. 'do not be afraid! i have been with him on many a \n","journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales of rivendell of \n","greater deeds of his than any that i have seen. he will not go astray-if \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","there is any path to find. he has led us in here against our fears, but he \n","will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. he is surer of finding \n","the way home in a blind night than the cats of queen berthiel.' \n","\n","it was well for the company that they had such a guide. they had no \n","fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors \n","many things had been left behind. but without any light they would soon have \n","come to grief. there were not only many roads to choose from, there were \n","also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in \n","which their passing feet echoed. there were fissures and chasms in the walls \n","and floor, and every now and then a crack would open right before their \n","feet. the widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before \n","pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap. the noise \n","of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was \n","turning in the depths. \n","\n","'rope! ' muttered sam. 'i knew i'd want it, if i hadn't got it! ' \n","\n","as these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. \n","already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the \n","mountains' roots. they were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort \n","in the thought of halting anywhere. frodo's spirits had risen for a while \n","after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a \n","deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. though he had been \n","healed in rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been \n","without effect. his senses were sharper and more aware of things that could \n","not be seen. one sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could \n","see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps gandalf. and \n","he was in any case the bearer of the ring: it hung upon its chain against \n","his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. he felt the certainty of \n","evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. he gripped tighter on \n","the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly. \n","\n","the company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers. \n","there was no sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of \n","gimli's dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of boromir; the light step of legolas; \n","the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm \n","footfalls of aragorn with his long stride. when they halted for a moment \n","they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and \n","drip of unseen water. yet frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard, \n","something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. it was never loud \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once \n","it had started it never stopped, while the company was moving. but it was \n","not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, \n","and then grew still. \n","\n","it was after nightfall when they had entered the mines. they had been \n","going for several hours with only brief halts, when gandalf came to his \n","first serious check. before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three \n","passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the \n","left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the \n","middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow. \n","\n","'i have no memory of this place at all!' said gandalf, standing \n","uncertainly under the arch. he held up his staff in the hope of finding some \n","marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was \n","to be seen. i am too weary to decide,' he said, shaking his head. 'and i \n","expect that you are all as weary as i am, or wearier. we had better halt \n","here for what is left of the night. you know what i mean! in here it is ever \n","dark; but outside the late moon is riding westward and the middle-night has \n","passed.' \n","\n","'poor old bill! ' said sam. 'i wonder where he is. i hope those wolves \n","haven't got him yet.' \n","\n","to the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half \n","closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. beyond there seemed to lie \n","a wide chamber cut in the rock. \n","\n","'steady! steady! ' cried gandalf as merry and pippin pushed forward, \n","glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of \n","shelter than in the open passage. 'steady! you do not know what is inside \n","yet. i will go first.' \n","\n","he went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. 'there! ' he said, \n","pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. before his feet they saw \n","a large round hole like the mouth of a well. broken and rusty chains lay at \n","the edge and trailed down into the black pit. fragments of stone lay near. \n","\n","'one of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were \n","going to strike the bottom,' said aragorn to merry. 'let the guide go first \n","while you have one.' \n","\n","'this seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the \n","three passages,' said gimli. 'that hole was plainly a well for the guards' \n","use, covered with a stone lid. but the lid is broken, and we must all take \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","care in the dark.' \n","\n","pippin felt curiously attracted by the well. while the others were \n","unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far \n","as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered \n","over. a chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths. \n","moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. he \n","felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound. then far below, \n","as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there \n","came a plunk , very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft. \n","\n","'what's that? ' cried gandalf. he was relieved when pippin confessed \n","what he had done; but he was angry, and pippin could see his eye glinting. \n","'fool of a took! ' he growled. 'this is a serious journey, not a hobbit \n","walking -party. throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further \n","nuisance. now be quiet! ' \n","\n","nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of \n","the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. they stopped, and when the echoes \n","had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. they \n","sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the \n","knocking died away and was not heard again. \n","\n","'that was the sound of a hammer, or i have never heard one,' said \n","gimli. \n","\n","'yes,' said gandalf, 'and i do not like it. it may have nothing to do \n","with peregrin's foolish stone; but probably something has been disturbed \n","that would have been better left quiet. pray, do nothing of the kind again! \n","\n","let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. you, pippin, can \n","go on the first watch, as a reward,' he growled, as he rolled himself in a \n","blanket. \n","\n","pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on \n","turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the \n","well. he wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he \n","dared not move or go near it, even though gandalf seemed to be asleep. \n","\n","actually gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. he was deep \n","in thought, trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the \n","mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a \n","false turn now might be disastrous. after an hour he rose up and came over \n","to pippin. \n","\n","'get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,' he said in a kindly tone. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'you want to sleep, i expect. i cannot get a wink, so i may as well do the \n","watching.' \n","\n","'i know what is the matter with me,' he muttered, as he sat down by the \n","door. 'i need smoke ! i have not tasted it since the morning before the \n","snowstorm.' \n","\n","the last thing that pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse \n","of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his \n","gnarled hands between his knees. the flicker for a moment showed his sharp \n","nose, and the puff of smoke. \n","\n","it was gandalf who roused them all from sleep. he had sat and watched \n","all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest. 'and in the \n","watches i have made up my mind,' he said. 'i do not like the feel of the \n","middle way; and i do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul \n","air down there, or i am no guide. i shall take the right-hand passage. it is \n","time we began to climb up again.' \n","\n","for eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on; \n","and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint \n","gleam of the wizard's light, bobbing like a will-o'-the-wisp in front of \n","them. the passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. as far as they \n","could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier \n","and wider. there were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on \n","either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks. \n","evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they \n","went forward quicker than they had done on their first march. \n","\n","in this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line \n","east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more. as the \n","road climbed upwards' frodo's spirits rose a little; but he still felt \n","oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the \n","company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep \n","that was not an echo. \n","\n","they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and \n","all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls \n","to right and left vanished. they seemed to have passed through some arched \n","doorway into a black and empty space. there was a great draught of warmer \n","air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. they \n","halted and crowded anxiously together. \n","\n","gandalf seemed pleased. 'i chose the right way,' he said. 'at last we \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","are coming to the habitable parts, and i guess that we are not far now from \n","the eastern side. but we are high up, a good deal higher than the dimrill \n","gate, unless i am mistaken. from the feeling of the air we must be in a wide \n","hall. i will now risk a little real light.' \n","\n","he raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was blaze like a \n","flash of lightning. great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they \n","saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of \n","stone. before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black \n","walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. three other \n","entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, \n","and one on either side. then the light went out. \n","\n","'that is all that i shall venture on for the present,' said gandalf. \n","\n","'there used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out \n","to the light in the upper reaches of the mines. i think we have reached them \n","now, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning. if i \n","am right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. but in the \n","meanwhile we had better go no further. let us rest, if we can. things have \n","gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. but we are \n","not through yet, and it is a long way down to the gates that open on the \n","world.' \n","\n","the company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close \n","together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady \n","inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. all about them as they lay \n","hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the \n","loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs \n","and passages. the wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to \n","the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria. \n","\n","'there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time ' said \n","sam; 'and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to \n","make all this, and most in hard rock too! what did they do it all for? they \n","didn't live in these darksome holes surely? ' \n","\n","'these are not holes,' said gimli. 'this is the great realm and city of \n","the dwarrowdelf. and of old it was not darksome, but full of light and \n","splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.' \n","\n","he rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, \n","while the echoes ran away into the roof. \n","\n","the world was young, the mountains green, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","no stain yet on the moon was seen, \n","\n","no words were laid on stream or stone \n","when durin woke and walked alone. \n","\n","he named the nameless hills and dells; \n","he drank from yet untasted wells; \n","\n","he stooped and looked in mirrormere, \n","and saw a crown of stars appear, \n","\n","as gems upon a silver thread, \n","\n","above the shadow of his head. \n","\n","the world was fair, the mountains tall, \n","in elder days before the fall \n","of mighty kings in nargothrond \n","and gondolin, who now beyond \n","the western seas have passed away: \n","the world was fair in durin 's day. \n","\n","a king he was on carven throne \n","in many-pillared halls of stone \n","with golden roof and silver floor, \n","\n","and runes of power upon the door. \n","\n","the light of sun and star and moon \n","in shining lamps of crystal hewn \n","undimmed by cloud or shade of night \n","there shone for ever fair and bright. \n","\n","there hammer on the anvil smote, \n","\n","there chisel clove, and graver wrote; \n","there forged was blade, and bound was \n","the delver mined, the mason built. \n","there beryl, pearl, and opal pale, \n","\n","and metal wrought like fishes' mail, \n","buckler and corslet, axe and sword, \n","and shining spears were laid in hoard. \n","\n","unwearied then were durin 's folk \n","beneath the mountains music woke: \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the harpers harped, the minstrels sang, \n","and at the gates the trumpets rang. \n","\n","\n","\n","the world is grey, the mountains old, \n","\n","the forge's fire is ashen-cold \n","no harp is wrung, no hammer falls: \n","\n","the darkness dwells in durin 's halls \n","the shadow lies upon his tomb \n","in moria, in khazad-dym. \n","\n","but still the sunken stars appear \n","in dark and windless mirrormere; \n","\n","there lies his crown in water deep, \n","\n","till durin wakes again from sleep. \n","\n","'i like that! ' said sam. v i should like to learn it. in moria, in \n","khazad-dym ! but it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those \n","lamps. are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here still? ' \n","\n","gimli was silent. having sung his song he would say no more. \n","\n","'piles of jewels? ' said gandalf. 'no. the ores have often plundered \n","moria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. and since the dwarves fled, \n","no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they \n","are drowned in water- or in a shadow of fear.' \n","\n","'then what do the dwarves want to come back for? ' asked sam. \n","\n","'for mithrif answered gandalf. 'the wealth of moria was not in gold \n","and jewels, the toys of the dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. such things \n","they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve \n","for them: all things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. for \n","here alone in the world was found moria-silver, or true-silver as some have \n","called it: mithril is the elvish name. the dwarves have a name which they do \n","not tell. its worth was ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond price; \n","for little is left above ground, and even the ores dare not delve here for \n","it. the lodes lead away north towards caradhras, and down to darkness. the \n","dwarves tell no tale; but even as mithril was the foundation of their \n","wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too \n","deep, and disturbed that from which they fled, durin's bane. of what they \n","brought to light the ores have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute \n","to sauron, who covets it. \n","\n","' mithril! all folk desired it. it could be beaten like copper, and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","polished like glass; and the dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet \n","harder than tempered steel. its beauty was like to that of common silver, \n","but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim. the elves dearly \n","loved it, and among many uses they made of it ithildin , starmoon, which you \n","saw upon the doors. bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that thorin gave \n","him. i wonder what has become of it? gathering dust still in michel delving \n","mathom-house, i suppose.' \n","\n","'what? ' cried gimli, startled out of his silence. 'a corslet of \n","moria- silver? that was a kingly gift! ' \n","\n","'yes,' said gandalf. i never told him, but its worth was greater than \n","the value of the whole shire and everything in it.' \n","\n","frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the \n","rings of his mail-shirt. he felt staggered to think that he had been walking \n","about with the price of the shire under his jacket. had bilbo known? he felt \n","no doubt that bilbo knew quite well. it was indeed a kingly gift. but now \n","his thoughts had been carried away from the dark mines, to rivendell, to \n","bilbo, and to bag end in the days while bilbo was still there. he wished \n","with all his heart that he was back there, and in those days, mowing the \n","lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of moria, \n","or mithril - or the ring. \n","\n","a deep silence fell. one by one the others fell asleep. frodo was on \n","guard. as if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep \n","places, dread came over him. his hands were cold and his brow damp. he \n","listened. all his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow \n","hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall. \n","\n","his watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the \n","western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points of \n","light, almost like luminous eyes. he started. his head had nodded. 'i must \n","have nearly fallen asleep on guard,' he thought. 'i was on the edge of a \n","dream.' he stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into \n","the dark, until he was relieved by legolas. \n","\n","when he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that \n","the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light \n","approaching, slowly. he woke and found that the others were speaking softly \n","near him, and that a dim light was falling on his face. high up above the \n","eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and \n","across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","distantly. \n","\n","frodo sat up. 'good morning! 'said gandalf: 'for morning it is again \n","at last. i was right, you see. we are high up on the east side of moria. \n","before today is over we ought to find the great gates and see the waters of \n","mirrormere lying in the dimrill dale before us.' \n","\n","'i shall be glad,' said gimli. 'i have looked on moria, and it is very \n","great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my \n","kindred. i doubt now that balin ever came here.' \n","\n","after they had breakfasted gandalf decided to go on again at once. 'we \n","are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,' he said. 'i think \n","that none of us will wish to spend another night in moria.' \n","\n","'no indeed! ' said boromir. 'which way shall we take? yonder eastward \n","arch? ' \n","\n","'maybe,' said gandalf. 'but i du not know yet exactly where we are. \n","unless i am quite astray, i guess that we are above and to the north of the \n","great gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. the \n","eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before \n","we make up our minds we ought to look about us. let us go towards that light \n","in the north door. if we could find a window it would help, but i fear that \n","the light comes only down deep shafts.' \n","\n","following his lead the company passed under the northern arch. they \n","found themselves in a wide corridor. as they went along it the glimmer grew \n","stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. it was \n","high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing \n","half open. beyond it was a large square chamber. it was dimly lit, but to \n","their eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, \n","and they blinked as they entered. \n","\n","their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among \n","things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out. \n","the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it \n","slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be \n","seen. the light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the \n","room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a \n","great slab of white stone. \n","\n","'it looks like a tomb,' muttered frodo, and bent forwards with a \n","curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. gandalf came \n","quickly to his side. on the slab runes were deeply graven: \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","these are daeron's runes, such as were used of old in moria,' said \n","gandalf. 'here is written in the tongues of men and dwarves: \n","balin son of fundin \n","lord of moria.' \n","\n","'he is dead then,' said frodo. t feared it was so.' gimli cast his \n","hood over his face. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 5 . the bridge of khazad-dym \n","\n","\n","\n","the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin. frodo \n","thought of bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and of balin's \n","visit to the shire long ago. in that dusty chamber in the mountains it \n","seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world. \n","\n","at length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything \n","that would give them tidings of balin's fate, or show what had become of his \n","folk. there was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under \n","the shaft. by both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying, \n","and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and \n","helms. some of the swords were crooked: ore-scimitars with blackened blades. \n","\n","there were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were \n","large iron-bound chests of wood. all had been broken and plundered; but \n","beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. it had been \n","slashed and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and \n","other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. gandalf \n","lifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the \n","slab. he pored over it for some time without speaking. frodo and gimli \n","standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they \n","were written by many different hands, in runes, both of moria and of dale, \n","and here and there in elvish script. \n","\n","at last gandalf looked up. 'it seems to be a record of the fortunes of \n","balin's folk,' he said. v i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill \n","dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers referring to \n","the years after their arrival. the top page is marked one - three, so at \n","least two are missing from the beginning. listen to this! \n","\n","'we drove out ores from the great gate and guard - i think; the next \n","word is blurred and burned; probably room - we slew many in the bright - i \n","think - sun in the dale. flui was killed by an arrow. he slew the great. \n","\n","then there is a blur followed by flui under grass near mirror mere. the next \n","line or two i cannot read. then comes we have taken the twentyfirst hall of \n","north end to dwell in. there is i cannot read what. a shaft is mentioned. \n","\n","then balin has set up his seat in the chamber of mazarbul.' \n","\n","'the chamber of records,' said gimli. v i guess that is where we now \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","stand.' \n","\n","'well, i can read no more for a long way,' said gandalf, 'except the \n","word gold , and darin 's axe and something helm. then balin is now lord of \n","morici. that seems to end a chapter. after some stars another hand begins, \n","and i can see we found truesilver, and later the word wellforged and then \n","something, i have it! mithril; and the last two lines uin to seek for the \n","upper armouries of third deep, something go westwards, a blur, to hollin \n","gate' \n","\n","gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. 'there are several pages of \n","the same sort, rather hastily written and much damaged, he said; 'but i can \n","make little of them in this light. now there must be a number of leaves \n","missing, because they begin to be numbered five, the fifth year of the \n","colony, i suppose. let me see! no, they are too cut and stained; i cannot \n","read them. we might do better in the sunlight. wait! here is something: a \n","large bold hand using an elvish script.' \n","\n","'that would be ori's hand,' said gimli, looking over the wizard's arm. \n","\n","'he could write well and speedily, and often used the elvish characters.' \n","\n","'i fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,' said gandalf. \n","\n","'the first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it \n","ends in estre. yes, it must be yestre followed by day being the tenth of \n","novembre balin lord of moria fell in dimrill dale. he went alone to look in \n","mirror mere, an ore shot him from behind a stone, we slew the ore, hut many \n","more ...up from east up the silverlode. the remainder of the page is so \n","blurred that i can hardly make anything out, but i think i can read we have \n","barred the gates, and then can hold them long if, and then perhaps horrible \n","and suffer. poor balin! he seems to have kept the title that he took for \n","less than five years. i wonder what happened afterwards; but there is no \n","time to puzzle out the last few pages. here is the last page of all.' he \n","paused and sighed. \n","\n","'it is grim reading,' he said. 'i fear their end was cruel. listen! we \n","cannot get out. we cannot get out. they have taken the bridge and second \n","hall. frbr and luni and nbli fell there. then there are four lines smeared \n","so that i can only read went 5 days ago. the last lines run the pool is up \n","to the wall at westgate. the watcher in the water took uin. we cannot get \n","out. the end comes, and then drums, drums in the deep. i wonder what that \n","means. the last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf-letters: they \n","are coming. there is nothing more.' gandalf paused and stood in silent \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","thought. \n","\n","a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the company. ' we \n","cannot get out,' muttered gimli. 'it was well for us that the pool had sunk \n","a little, and that the watcher was sleeping down at the southern end.' \n","\n","gandalf raised his head and looked round. 'they seem to have made a \n","last stand by both doors,' he said; 'but there were not many left by that \n","time. so ended the attempt to retake moria! it was valiant but foolish. the \n","time is not come yet. now, i fear, we must say farewell to balin son of \n","fundin. here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. we will take this \n","book, the book of mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. you had \n","better keep it, gimli, and take it back to dbin, if you get a chance. it \n","will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. come, let us go! the \n","morning is passing.' \n","\n","'which way shall we go? ' asked boromir. \n","\n","'back to the hall,' answered gandalf. 'but our visit to this room has \n","not been in vain. i now know where we are. this must be, as gimli says, the \n","chamber of mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the north-end. \n","therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear right \n","and south, and go downwards. the twenty-first hall should be on the seventh \n","level, that is six above the level of the gates. come now! back to the hall! \n","\n","f \n","\n","gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a \n","rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in \n","the stone at their feet. they sprang towards the door in alarm. doom, doom \n","it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of moria \n","into a vast drum. then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown \n","in the hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off. \n","\n","there was a hurrying sound of many feet. \n","\n","'they are coming! ' cried legolas. \n","\n","'we cannot get out,' said gimli. \n","\n","'trapped! ' cried gandalf. 'why did i delay? here we are, caught, just \n","as they were before. but i was not here then. we will see what - ' \n","\n","doom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook. \n","\n","'slam the doors and wedge them! ' shouted aragorn. 'and keep your packs \n","on as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.' \n","\n","'no! ' said gandalf. 'we must not get shut in. keep the east door ajar! \n","\n","we will go that way, if we get a chance.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","another harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. feet were coming \n","down the corridor. there was a ring and clatter as the company drew their \n","swords. glamdring shone with a pale light, and sting glinted at the edges. \n","boromir set his shoulder against the western door. \n","\n","'wait a moment! do not close it yet! ' said gandalf. he sprang forward \n","to boromir's side and drew himself up to his full height. \n","\n","'who comes hither to disturb the rest of balin lord of moria? ' he \n","cried in a loud voice. \n","\n","there was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding stones \n","into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. doom, \n","boom, \n","\n","doom went the drums in the deep. \n","\n","with a quick movement gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the \n","door and thrust forward his staff: there was a dazzling flash that lit the \n","chamber and the passage outside. for an instant the wizard looked out. \n","arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back. \n","\n","'there are ores, very many of them,' he said. 'and some are large and \n","evil: black uruks of mordor. for the moment they are hanging back, but there \n","is something else there. a great cave-troll, i think, or more than one. \n","\n","there is no hope of escape that way.' \n","\n","'and no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,' said \n","boromir. \n","\n","'there is no sound outside here yet,' said aragorn, who was standing by \n","the eastern door listening. 'the passage on this side plunges straight down \n","a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. but it is no good \n","flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind. we cannot block the \n","door. its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. we must \n","do something to delay the enemy first. we will make them fear the chamber of \n","mazarbul!' he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword, andril. \n","\n","heavy feet were heard in the corridor. boromir flung himself against \n","the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and \n","splinters of wood. the company retreated to the other side of the chamber. \n","but they had no chance to fly yet. there was a blow on the door that made it \n","quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. a \n","huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust \n","through the widening gap. then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced \n","through below. there was a dead silence outside. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his \n","sword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his shaken hand. the blade was \n","notched. \n","\n","suddenly, and to his own surprise, frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in \n","his heart. 'the shire! ' he cried, and springing beside boromir, he stooped, \n","and stabbed with sting at the hideous foot. there was a bellow, and the foot \n","jerked back, nearly wrenching sting from frodo's arm. black drops dripped \n","from the blade and smoked on the floor. boromir hurled himself against the \n","door and slammed it again. \n","\n","'one for the shire! ' cried aragorn. 'the hobbit's bite is deep! you \n","have a good blade, frodo son of drogo ! ' \n","\n","there was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. rams and \n","hammers were beating against it. it cracked and staggered back, and the \n","opening grew suddenly wide. arrows came whistling in, but struck the \n","northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor. there was a horn-blast and \n","a rush of feet, and ores one after another leaped into the chamber. \n","\n","how many there were the company could not count. the affray was sharp, \n","but the ores were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence. legolas shot \n","two through the throat. gimli hewed the legs from under another that had \n","sprung up on balin' s tomb. boromir and aragorn slew many. when thirteen \n","had \n","\n","fallen the rest fled shrieking, leaving the defenders unharmed, except for \n","sam who had a scratch along the scalp. a quick duck had saved him; and he \n","had felled his ore: a sturdy thrust with his barrow-blade. a fire was \n","smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made ted sandyman step \n","backwards, if he had seen it. \n","\n","'now is the time! ' cried gandalf. 'let us go, before the troll \n","returns!' \n","\n","but even as they retreated, and before pippin and merry had reached the \n","stair outside, a huge ore-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail \n","from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers \n","clustered in the doorway. his broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like \n","coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. with a thrust of \n","his huge hide shield he turned boromir's sword and bore him backwards, \n","throwing him to the ground. diving under aragorn's blow with the speed of a \n","striking snake he charged into the company and thrust with his spear \n","straight at frodo. the blow caught him on the right side, and frodo was \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","hurled against the wall and pinned. sam, with a cry, hacked at the \n","spear- shaft, and it broke. but even as the ore flung down the truncheon and \n","swept out his scimitar, andril came down upon his helm. there was a flash \n","like flame and the helm burst asunder. the ore fell with cloven head. his \n","followers fled howling, as boromir and aragorn sprang at them. \n","\n","doom, doom went the drums in the deep. the great voice rolled out \n","again. \n","\n","'now! ' shouted gandalf. 'now is the last chance. run for it! ' \n","\n","aragorn picked up frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the \n","stair, pushing merry and pippin in front of him. the others followed; but \n","gimli had to be dragged away by legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered \n","by balin's tomb with his head bowed. boromir hauled the eastern door to, \n","grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on either side, but could \n","not be fastened. \n","\n","'i am all right,' gasped frodo. 'i can walk. put me down! ' \n","\n","aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. 'i thought you were dead! \n","\n","' he cried. \n","\n","'not yet! ' said gandalf. 'but there is time for wonder. off you go, \n","all of you, down the stairs! wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if \n","i do not come soon, go on! go quickly and choose paths leading right and \n","downwards.' \n","\n","'we cannot leave you to hold the door alone! ' said aragorn. \n","\n","'do as i say! ' said gandalf fiercely. 'swords are no more use here. \n","\n","go!' \n","\n","the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. they groped their \n","way down a long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they could see \n","nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard's staff. he \n","seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door. frodo breathed \n","heavily and leaned against sam, who put his arms about him. they stood \n","peering up the stairs into the darkness. frodo thought he could hear the \n","voice of gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with \n","a sighing echo. he could not catch what was said. the walls seemed to be \n","trembling. every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: doom, \n","doom. \n","\n","suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. then \n","there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. the drum-beats broke out wildly: \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","doom-boom, doom-boom, and then stopped. gandalf came flying down the \n","steps \n","\n","and fell to the ground in the midst of the company. \n","\n","'well, well! that's over! ' said the wizard struggling to his feet. 'i \n","have done all that i could. but i have met my match, and have nearly been \n","destroyed. but don't stand here! go on! you will have to do without light \n","for a while: i am rather shaken. go on! go on! where are you, gimli? come \n","ahead with me! keep close behind, all of you!' \n","\n","they stumbled after him wondering what had happened. doom, doom \n","went \n","\n","the drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were \n","following. there was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor \n","any voice. gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to \n","be going in the direction that he desired. every now and again it descended \n","a flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. at the moment that was \n","their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they \n","came on it, and put their feet out into emptiness. gandalf felt the ground \n","with his staff like a blind man. \n","\n","at the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and \n","had descended many flights of stairs. there was still no sound of pursuit. \n","almost they began to hope that they would escape. at the bottom of the \n","seventh flight gandalf halted. \n","\n","'it is getting hot! ' he gasped. 'we ought to be down at least to the \n","level of the gates now. soon i think we should look for a left-hand turn to \n","take us east. i hope it is not far. i am very weary. i must rest here a \n","moment, even if all the ores ever spawned are after us.' \n","\n","gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. 'what \n","happened away up there at the door? ' he asked. 'did you meet the beater of \n","the drums? ' \n","\n","'i do not know,' answered gandalf. 'but i found myself suddenly faced \n","by something that i have not met before. i could think of nothing to do but \n","to try and put a shutting -spell on the door. i know many; but to do things \n","of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by \n","strength. \n","\n","'as i stood there i could hear ore- voices on the other side: at any \n","moment i thought they would burst it open. i could not hear what was said; \n","they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. all i caught was \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","ghvsh; that is \"fire\". then something came into the chamber - i felt it \n","through the door, and the ores themselves were afraid and fell silent. it \n","laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell. \n","\n","'what it was i cannot guess, but i have never felt such a challenge. \n","\n","the counter-spell was terrible. it nearly broke me. for an instant the door \n","left my control and began to open ! i had to speak a word of command. that \n","proved too great a strain. the door burst in pieces. something dark as a \n","cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and i was thrown backwards down \n","the stairs. all the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, i \n","think. \n","\n","'i am afraid balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried \n","there too. i cannot say. but at least the passage behind us was completely \n","blocked. ah! i have never felt so spent, but it is passing. and now what \n","about you, frodo? there was not time to say so, but i have never been more \n","delighted in my life than when you spoke. i feared that it was a brave but \n","dead hobbit that aragorn was carrying.' \n","\n","'what about me? ' said frodo. 'i am alive, and whole i think. i am \n","bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.' \n","\n","'well,' said aragorn, 'i can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff \n","so tough that i have never met the like of it. had i known, i would have \n","spoken softer in the inn at bree! that spear -thrust would have skewered a \n","wild boar! ' \n","\n","'well, it did not skewer me, i am glad to say,' said frodo; 'though i \n","feel as if i had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.' he said no \n","more. he found breathing painful. \n","\n","'you take after bilbo,' said gandalf. 'there is more about you than \n","meets the eye, as i said of him long ago.' frodo wondered if the remark \n","meant more than it said. \n","\n","they now went on again. before long gimli spoke. he had keen eyes in \n","the dark. 'i think,' he said, 'that there is a light ahead. but it is not \n","daylight. it is red. what can it be? ' \n","\n","' ghvsh !' muttered gandalf. 'i wonder if that is what they meant: that \n","the lower levels are on fire? still, we can only go on.' \n","\n","soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. it was \n","flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them. they \n","could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way \n","ahead there stood a low archway; through it the glowing light came. the air \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","became very hot. \n","\n","when they came to the arch gandalf went through, signing to them to \n","wait. as he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red \n","glow. quickly he stepped back. \n","\n","'there is some new devilry here,' he said, 'devised for our welcome no \n","doubt. but i know now where we are: we have reached the first deep, the \n","level immediately below the gates. this is the second hall of old moria; and \n","the gates are near: away beyond the eastern end, on the left, not more than \n","a quarter of a mile. across the bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road \n","through the first hall, and out! but come and look! ' \n","\n","they peered out. before them was another cavernous hall. it was loftier \n","and far longer than the one in which they had slept. they were near its \n","eastern end; westward it ran away into darkness. down the centre stalked a \n","double line of towering pillars. they were carved like boles of mighty trees \n","whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. their stems \n","were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides. \n","right across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great \n","fissure had opened. out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again \n","flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. wisps \n","of dark smoke wavered in the hot air. \n","\n","'if we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should \n","have been trapped here,' said gandalf. 'let us hope that the fire now lies \n","between us and pursuit. come! there is no time to lose.' \n","\n","even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: doom, doom, \n","doom. away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came \n","cries and horn-calls. doom, doom : the pillars seemed to tremble and the \n","flames to quiver. \n","\n","'now for the last race! ' said gandalf. 'if the sun is shining outside \n","we may still escape. after me! ' \n","\n","he turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. the \n","distance was greater than it had looked. as they ran they heard the beat and \n","echo of many hurrying feet behind. a shrill yell went up: they had been \n","seen. there was a ring and clash of steel. an arrow whistled over frodo's \n","head. \n","\n","boromir laughed. 'they did not expect this,' he said. 'the fire has cut \n","them off. we are on the wrong side! ' \n","\n","'look ahead! ' called gandalf. 'the bridge is near. it is dangerous and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","narrow.' \n","\n","suddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm. at the end of the hall the \n","floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. the outer door could only be \n","reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the \n","chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet. it was an ancient defence of \n","the dwarves against any enemy that might capture the first hall and the \n","outer passages. they could only pass across it in single file. at the brink \n","gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind. \n","\n","'lead the way, gimli! ' he said. 'pippin and merry next. straight on \n","and up the stair beyond the door! ' \n","\n","arrows fell among them. one struck frodo and sprang back. another \n","pierced gandalf s hat and stuck there like a black feather. frodo looked \n","behind. beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be \n","hundreds of ores. they brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as \n","blood in the firelight. doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and \n","louder, doom, doom. \n","\n","legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long \n","shot for his small bow. he drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to \n","the ground. he gave a cry of dismay and fear. two great trolls appeared; \n","they bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways \n","over the fire. but it was not the trolls that had filled the elf with \n","terror. the ranks of the ores had opened, and they crowded away, as if they \n","themselves were afraid. something was coming up behind them. what it was \n","could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a \n","dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to \n","be in it and to go before it. \n","\n","it came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had \n","bent over it. then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. the flames \n","roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in \n","the air. its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. in its right hand \n","was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of \n","many thongs. \n","\n","'ai! ai! ' wailed legolas. 'a balrog! a balrog is come! ' \n","\n","gimli stared with wide eyes. 'durin's bane! ' he cried, and letting his \n","axe fall he covered his face. \n","\n","'a balrog,' muttered gandalf. 'now i understand.' he faltered and \n","leaned heavily on his staff. 'what an evil fortune! and i am already weary.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. the ores yelled \n","and poured over the stone gangways. then boromir raised his horn and blew. \n","loud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under \n","the cavernous roof. for a moment the ores quailed and the fiery shadow \n","halted. then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark \n","wind, and the enemy advanced again. \n","\n","'over the bridge!' cried gandalf, recalling his strength. \"fly ! this is \n","a foe beyond any of you. i must hold the narrow way. fly! ' aragorn and \n","boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side, \n","behind gandalf at the far end of the bridge. the others halted just within \n","the doorway at the hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to \n","face the enemy alone. \n","\n","the balrog reached the bridge. gandalf stood in the middle of the span, \n","leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand glamdring \n","gleamed, cold and white. his enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow \n","about it reached out like two vast wings. it raised the whip, and the thongs \n","whined and cracked. fire came from its nostrils. but gandalf stood firm. \n","\n","'you cannot pass,' he said. the ores stood still, and a dead silence \n","fell. v i am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of anor. you \n","cannot pass. the dark fire will not avail you, flame of udyn. go back to the \n","shadow! you cannot pass.' \n","\n","the balrog made no answer. the fire in it seemed to die, but the \n","darkness grew. it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it \n","drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to \n","wall; but still gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed \n","small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the \n","onset of a storm. \n","\n","from out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming. \n","\n","glamdring glittered white in answer. \n","\n","there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. the balrog fell \n","back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. the wizard swayed on the \n","bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still. \n","\n","'you cannot pass! ' he said. \n","\n","with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge. its whip whirled \n","and hissed. \n","\n","'he cannot stand alone! ' cried aragorn suddenly and ran back along the \n","bridge. 'elendil!' he shouted. 'i am with you, gandalf! ' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'gondor! ' cried boromir and leaped after him. \n","\n","at that moment gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the \n","bridge before him. the staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. a \n","blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. the bridge cracked. right at the \n","balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the \n","gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock \n","thrust out into emptiness. \n","\n","with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged \n","down and vanished. but even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs \n","lashed and curled about the wizard's knees, dragging him to the brink. he \n","staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. \n","\n","'fly, you fools! ' he cried, and was gone. \n","\n","the fires went out, and blank darkness fell. the company stood rooted \n","with horror staring into the pit. even as aragorn and boromir came flying \n","back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. with a cry aragorn roused \n","them. \n","\n","'come! i will lead you now ! ' he called. 'we must obey his last \n","command. follow me! ' \n","\n","they stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door. aragorn \n","leading, boromir at the rear. at the top was a wide echoing passage. along \n","this they fled. frodo heard sam at his side weeping, and then he found that \n","he himself was weeping as he ran. doom, doom, doom the drum-beats rolled \n","behind, mournful now and slow; doom! \n","\n","they ran on. the light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. \n","\n","they ran swifter. they passed into a hall, bright with daylight from its \n","high windows in the east. they fled across it. through its huge broken doors \n","they passed, and suddenly before them the great gates opened, an arch of \n","blazing light. \n","\n","there was a guard of ores crouching in the shadows behind the great \n","door posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast \n","down. aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and \n","the rest fled in terror of his wrath. the company swept past them and took \n","no heed of them. out of the gates they ran and sprang down the huge and \n","age-worn steps, the threshold of moria. \n","\n","thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on \n","their faces. \n","\n","they did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","dimrill dale lay about them. the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it, \n","but eastwards there was a golden light on the land. it was but one hour \n","after noon. the sun was shining; the clouds were white and high. \n","\n","they looked back. dark yawned the archway of the gates under the \n","mountain-shadow. faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats: \n","doom. a thin black smoke trailed out. nothing else was to be seen; the dale \n","all around was empty. doom. grief at last wholly overcame them, and they \n","wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. doom, doom. \n","the drum-beats faded. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 6 . lothlurien \n","\n","\n","\n","'alas! i fear we cannot stay here longer,' said aragorn. he looked \n","towards the mountains and held up his sword. 'farewell, gandalf ! ' he cried. \n","'did i not say to you: if you pass the doors of moria, bewarel alas that i \n","spoke true! what hope have we without you? ' \n","\n","he turned to the company. 'we must do without hope,' he said. 'at least \n","we may yet be avenged. let us gird ourselves and weep no more! come! we \n","have \n","\n","a long road, and much to do.' \n","\n","they rose and looked about them. northward the dale ran up into a glen \n","of shadows between two great arms of the mountains, above which three white \n","peaks were shining: celebdil, fanuidhol, caradhras. the mountains of moria. \n","at the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless \n","ladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the \n","mountains' feet. \n","\n","'yonder is the dimrill stair,' said aragorn, pointing to the falls. \n","\n","'down the deep-cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have \n","come, if fortune had been kinder.' \n","\n","'or caradhras less cruel,' said gimli. 'there he stands smiling in the \n","sun! ' he shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped peaks and turned \n","away. \n","\n","to the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, \n","and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and vague. to the south \n","the misty mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. less than \n","a mile away, and a little below them, for they still stood high up on the \n","west side of the dale, there lay a mere. it was long and oval, shaped like a \n","great spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end \n","was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky. yet its waters were dark: a \n","deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. its face was \n","still and unruffled. about it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides \n","to its bare unbroken rim. \n","\n","'there lies the mirrormere, deep kheled-zvram! ' said gimli sadly. 'i \n","remember that he said: \"may you have joy of the sight! but we cannot linger \n","there.\" now long shall i journey ere i have joy again. it is i that must \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","hasten away, and he that must remain.' \n","\n","the company now went down the road from the gates. it was rough and \n","broken, fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid \n","the cracking stones. but still it could be seen that once long ago a great \n","paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf-kingdom. \n","\n","in \n","\n","places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green \n","topped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. an eastward \n","bend led them hard by the sward of mirrormere, and there not far from the \n","roadside stood a single column broken at the top. \n","\n","'that is durin's stone! ' cried gimli. 'i cannot pass without turning \n","aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale ! ' \n","\n","'be swift then! ' said aragorn, looking back towards the gates. 'the \n","sun sinks early. the ores will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we \n","must be far away before nightfall. the moon is almost spent, and it will be \n","dark tonight.' \n","\n","'come with me, frodo! ' cried the dwarf, springing from the road. 'i \n","would not have you go without seeing kheled-zvram.' he ran down the long \n","green slope. frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite \n","of hurt and weariness; sam came up behind. \n","\n","beside the standing stone gimli halted and looked up. it was cracked \n","and weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. 'this \n","pillar marks the spot where durin first looked in the mirrormere,' said the \n","dwarf. 'let us look ourselves once, ere we go!' \n","\n","they stooped over the dark water. at first they could see nothing. then \n","slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound \n","blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there \n","was a space of sky. there like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars, \n","though sunlight was in the sky above. of their own stooping forms no shadow \n","could be seen. \n","\n","'o kheled-zvram fair and wonderful! ' said gimli. 'there lies the crown \n","of durin till he wakes. farewell! ' he bowed, and turned away, and hastened \n","back up the green-sward to the road again. \n","\n","'what did you see? ' said pippin to sam, but sam was too deep in \n","thought to answer. \n","\n","the road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from \n","between the arms of the dale. some way below the mere they came on a deep \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","well of water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip \n","and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel. \n","\n","'here is the spring from which the silverlode rises.' said gimli. 'do \n","not drink of it! it is icy cold.' \n","\n","'soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other \n","mountain- streams,' said aragorn. 'our road leads beside it for many miles. \n","for i shall take you by the road that gandalf chose, and first i hope to \n","come to the woods where the silverlode flows into the great river-out \n","yonder.' they looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the \n","stream leaping down to the trough of the valley, and then running on and \n","away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze. \n","\n","'there lie the woods of lothlurien! ' said legolas. 'that is the \n","fairest of all the dwellings of my people. there are no trees like the trees \n","of that land. for in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. not \n","till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the \n","boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, \n","and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the \n","trees is smooth and grey. so still our songs in mirkwood say. my heart would \n","be glad if i were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime ! ' \n","\n","'my heart will be glad, even in the winter,' said aragorn. 'but it lies \n","many miles away. let us hasten! ' \n","\n","for some time frodo and sam managed to keep up with the others; but \n","aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged \n","behind. they had eaten nothing since the early morning. sam's cut was \n","burning like fire, and his head felt light. in spite of the shining sun the \n","wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of moria. he shivered. frodo felt \n","every step more painful and he gasped for breath. \n","\n","at last legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to \n","aragorn. the others halted, and aragorn ran back, calling to boromir to come \n","with him. \n","\n","'i am sorry, frodo! ' he cried, full of concern. 'so much has happened \n","this day and we have such need of haste, that i have forgotten that you were \n","hurt; and sam too. you should have spoken. we have done nothing to ease \n","you, \n","\n","as we ought, though all the ores of moria were after us. come now! a little \n","further on there is a place where we can rest for a little. there i will do \n","what i can for you. come, boromir! we will carry them.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the \n","west, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying silverlode. together \n","they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone, and foamed down into a dell. \n","about it stood fir-trees, short and bent, and its sides were steep and \n","clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle -berry. at the bottom there \n","was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining \n","pebbles. here they rested. it was now nearly three hours after noon, and \n","they had come only a few miles from the gates. already the sun was \n","westering. \n","\n","while gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and \n","fir-wood, and drew water, aragorn tended sam and frodo. sam's wound was \n","not \n","\n","deep, but it looked ugly, and aragorn's face was grave as he examined it. \n","after a moment he looked up with relief. \n","\n","'good luck, sam! ' he said. 'many have received worse than this in \n","payment for the slaying of their first ore. the cut is not poisoned, as the \n","wounds of ore-blades too often are. it should heal well when i have tended \n","it. bathe it when gimli has heated water.' \n","\n","he opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. 'they are dry \n","and some of their virtue has one, he said, but here i have still some of the \n","leaves of athelas that i gathered near weathertop. crush one in the water, \n","and wash the wound clean, and i will bind it. now it is your turn. frodo! ' \n","\n","'i am all right,' said frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched. \n","\n","'all i needed was some food and a little rest.' \n","\n","'no! ' said aragorn. 'we must have a look and see what the hammer and \n","the anvil have done to you. i still marvel that you are alive at all.' \n","\n","gently he stripped off frodo's old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of \n","wonder. then he laughed. the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like \n","the light upon a rippling sea. carefully he took it off and held it up, and \n","the gems on it glittered like stars, and the sound of the shaken rings was \n","like the tinkle of rain in a pool. \n","\n","'look, my friends!' he called. 'here's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an \n","el ven -princeling in! if it were known that hobbits had such hides, all the \n","hunters of middle-earth would be riding to the shire.' \n","\n","'and all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,' \n","said gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. 'it is a mithril-coat. mithril! i \n","have never seen or heard tell of one so fair. is this the coat that gandalf \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","spoke of? then he undervalued it. but it was well given! ' \n","\n","'i have often wondered what you and bilbo were doing, so close in his \n","little room,' said merry. 'bless the old hobbit! i love him more than ever. \n","\n","i hope we get a chance of telling him about it! ' \n","\n","there was a dark and blackened bruise on frodo's right side and breast. \n","under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings \n","had been driven through it into the flesh. frodo's left side also was scored \n","and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall. while the others set \n","the food ready. aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was \n","steeped. the pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped \n","over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened. soon frodo felt the \n","pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to \n","the touch for many days. aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side. \n","\n","'the mail is marvellously light,' he said. 'put it on again, if you can \n","bear it. my heart is glad to know that you have such a coat. do not lay it \n","aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a \n","while; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.' \n","\n","when they had eaten, the company got ready to go on. they put out the \n","fire and hid all traces of it. then climbing out of the dell they took to \n","the road again. they had not gone far before the sun sank behind the \n","westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain-sides. dusk \n","veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. away in the east the \n","evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood. sam and \n","frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair \n","pace, and with only one brief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly \n","three more hours. \n","\n","it was dark. deep night had fallen. there were many clear stars, hut \n","the fast- waning moon would not be seen till late. gimli and frodo were at \n","the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound upon the \n","road behind. at length gimli broke the silence. \n","\n","'not a sound but the wind,' he said. 'there are no goblins near, or my \n","ears are made of wood. it is to be hoped that the ores will be content with \n","driving us from moria. and maybe that was all their purpose, and they had \n","nothing else to do with us-with the ring. though ores will often pursue foes \n","for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.' \n","\n","frodo did not answer. he looked at sting, and the blade was dull. yet \n","he had heard something, or thought he had. as soon as the shadows had fallen \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","about them and the road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter \n","of feet. even now he heard it. he turned swiftly. there were two tiny gleams \n","of light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they \n","slipped aside and vanished. \n","\n","'what is it? ' said the dwarf. \n","\n","'i don't know.' answered frodo. 'i thought i heard feet, and i thought \n","i saw a light-like eyes. i have thought so often, since we first entered \n","moria.' \n","\n","gimli halted and stooped to the ground. 'i hear nothing but the \n","night-speech of plant and stone,' he said. 'come! let us hurry! the others \n","are out of sight.' \n","\n","the night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. before them a \n","wide grey shadow loomed, and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like \n","poplars in the breeze. \n","\n","'lothlurien! ' cried legolas. 'lothlurien! we have come to the eaves of \n","the golden wood. alas that it is winter! ' \n","\n","under the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road \n","and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. in the dim \n","light of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint \n","of fallow gold. \n","\n","'lothlurien! ' said aragorn. 'glad i am to hear again the wind in the \n","trees! we are still little more than five leagues from the gates, but we can \n","go no further. here let us hope that the virtue of the elves will keep us \n","tonight from the peril that comes behind.' \n","\n","'if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,' said gimli. \n","\n","'it is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land \n","whence we wandered in ages long ago,' said legolas, 'but we hear that lurien \n","is not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here that holds evil from \n","the land. nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they dwell now \n","deep in the woods and far from the northern border.' \n","\n","'indeed deep in the wood they dwell,' said aragorn, and sighed as if \n","some memory stirred in him. 'we must fend for ourselves tonight. we will go \n","forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn \n","aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.' \n","\n","he stepped forward; but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow. \n","\n","'is there no other way? ' he said. \n","\n","'what other fairer way would you desire? ' said aragorn. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'a plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,' said boromir. \n","\n","'by strange paths has this company been led, and so far to evil fortune. \n","against my will we passed under the shades of moria, to our loss. and now we \n","must enter the golden wood, you say. but of that perilous land we have heard \n","in gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few \n","none have escaped unscathed.' \n","\n","'say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak \n","the truth said aragorn. but lore wanes in gondor, boromir, if in the city of \n","those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlurien. believe what you \n","will, there is no other way for us - unless you would go back to \n","moria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or swim the great river all \n","alone.' \n","\n","'then lead on! ' said boromir. 'but it is perilous.' \n","\n","'perilous indeed,' said aragorn, 'fair and perilous; but only evil need \n","fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. follow me! ' \n","\n","they had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came \n","upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad slopes that \n","climbed back westward towards the mountains. they heard it splashing over a \n","fall away among the shadows on their right. its dark hurrying waters ran \n","across the path before them, and joined the silverlode in a swirl of dim \n","pools among the roots of trees. \n","\n","'here is nimrodel! ' said legolas. 'of this stream the silvan elves \n","made many songs long ago, and still we sing them in the north, remembering \n","the rainbow on its falls, and the golden flowers that floated in its foam. \n","\n","all is dark now and the bridge of nimrodel is broken down. i will bathe my \n","feet, for it is said that the water is healing to the weary.' he went \n","forward and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream. \n","\n","'follow me!' he cried. 'the water is not deep. let us wade across! on \n","the further bank we can rest, and the sound of the falling water may bring \n","us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.' \n","\n","one by one they climbed down and followed legolas. for a moment frodo \n","stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet. it was cold \n","but its touch was clean, and as he went on and it mounted to his knees, he \n","felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs. \n","\n","when all the company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little \n","food; and legolas told them tales of lothlurien that the elves of mirkwood \n","still kept in their hearts, of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the great river before the world was grey. \n","\n","at length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall \n","running sweetly in the shadows. almost frodo fancied that he could hear a \n","voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water. \n","\n","'do you hear the voice of nimrodel? ' asked legolas. 'i will sing you a \n","song of the maiden nimrodel, who bore the same name as the stream beside \n","which she lived lung ago. it is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this \n","is how it runs in the westron speech, as some in rivendell now sing it.' in \n","a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he \n","began: \n","\n","an elven-maid there was of old, \n","\n","a shining star by day: \n","\n","her mantle white was hemmed with gold, \n","\n","her shoes of silver-grey. \n","\n","a star was bound upon her brows, \n","\n","a light was on her hair \n","as sun upon the golden boughs \n","in lurien the fair. \n","\n","her hair was long, her limbs were white, \n","\n","and fair she was and free; \n","\n","and in the wind she went as light \n","as leaf of linden-tree. \n","\n","beside the falls of nimrodel, \n","\n","by water clear and cool, \n","\n","her voice as falling silver fell \n","into the shining pool. \n","\n","where now she wanders none can tell, \n","\n","in sunlight or in shade; \n","\n","for lost of yore was nimrodel \n","and in the mountains strayed. \n","\n","the elven-ship in haven grey \n","beneath the mountain-lee \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","awaited her for many a day \n","beside the roaring sea. \n","\n","a wind by night in northern lands \n","arose, and loud it cried, \n","\n","and drove the ship from elven-strands \n","across the streaming tide. \n","\n","when dawn came dim the land was lost, \n","the mountains sinking grey \n","beyond the heaving waves that tossed \n","their plumes of blinding spray. \n","\n","amroth beheld the fading shore \n","now low beyond the swell, \n","\n","and cursed the faithless ship that bore \n","him far from nimrodel. \n","\n","of old he was an elven-king, \n","\n","a lord of tree and glen, \n","\n","when golden were the boughs in spring \n","in fair lothlurien. \n","\n","from helm to sea they saw him leap, \n","\n","as arrow from the string, \n","\n","and dive into the water deep, \n","\n","as mew upon the wing. \n","\n","the wind was in his flowing hair, \n","\n","the foam about him shone; \n","\n","afar they saw him strong and fair \n","go riding like a swan. \n","\n","but from the west has come no word, \n","and on the hither shore \n","no tidings elven-folk have heard \n","of amroth evermore. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the voice of legolas faltered, and the song ceased. 'i cannot sing any \n","more,' he said. 'that is but a part, for i have forgotten much. it is long \n","and sad, for it tells how sorrow came upon lothlurien, lurien of the \n","blossom, when the dwarves awakened evil in the mountains.' \n","\n","'but the dwarves did not make the evil,' said gimli. \n","\n","'i said not so; yet evil came,' answered legolas sadly. 'then many of \n","the elves of nimrodel's kindred left their dwellings and departed and she \n","was lost far in the south, in the passes of the white mountains; and she \n","came not to the ship where amroth her lover waited for her. but in the \n","spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be \n","heard by the falls that bear her name. and when the wind is in the south the \n","voice of amroth comes up from the sea; for nimrodel flows into silverlode, \n","that elves call celebrant, and celebrant into anduin the great, and anduin \n","flows into the bay of b elf alas whence the elves of lurien set sail. but \n","neither nimrodel nor amroth ever came back. \n","\n","'it is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that \n","grew near the falls; for that was the custom of the elves of lurien, to \n","dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. therefore they were called the \n","galadhrim, the tree -people. deep in their forest the trees are very great. \n","\n","the people of the woods did not delve in the ground like dwarves, nor build \n","strong places of stone before the shadow came.' \n","\n","'and even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought \n","safer than sitting on the ground,' said gimli. he looked across the stream \n","to the road that led back to dimrill dale, and then up into the roof of dark \n","boughs above. \n","\n","'your words bring good counsel, gimli,' said aragorn. 'we cannot build \n","a house, but tonight we will do as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the \n","tree-tops, if we can. we have sat here beside the road already longer than \n","was wise.' \n","\n","the company now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of \n","the deeper woods, westward along the mountain-stream away from \n","silverlode. \n","\n","not far from the falls of nimrodel they found a cluster of trees, some of \n","which overhung the stream. their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but \n","their height could not be guessed. \n","\n","'i will climb up,' said legolas. 'i am at home among trees, by root or \n","bough, though these trees are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","song. mellyrn they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, \n","but i have never climbed in one. i will see now what is their shape and way \n","of growth.' \n","\n","'whatever it may be,' said pippin, 'they will be marvellous trees \n","indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds. i cannot sleep \n","on a perch ! ' \n","\n","'then dig a hole in the ground,' said legolas, 'if that is more after \n","the fashion of your kind. but you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to \n","hide from ores.' he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch \n","that grew from the trunk high above his head. but even as he swung there for \n","a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him. \n","\n","' daro !' it said in commanding tone, and legolas dropped back to earth \n","in surprise and fear. he shrank against the bole of the tree. \n","\n","'stand still! ' he whispered to the others. 'do not move or speak! ' \n","\n","there was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another \n","clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. frodo could understand little of what \n","was said, for the speech that the silvan folk east of the mountains used \n","among themselves was unlike that of the west. legolas looked up and \n","answered \n","\n","in the same language.* \n","\n","'who are they, and what do they say? ' asked merry. \n","\n","'they're elves,' said sam. 'can't you hear their voices? ' \n","\n","'yes, they are elves,' said legolas; 'and they say that you breathe so \n","loud that they could shoot you in the dark.' sam hastily put his hand over \n","his mouth. 'but they say also that you need have no fear. they have been \n","aware of us for a long while. they heard my voice across the nimrodel, and \n","knew that i was one of their northern kindred, and therefore they did not \n","hinder our crossing; and afterwards they heard my song. now they bid me \n","climb up with frodo; for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of \n","our journey. the others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the \n","foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.' \n","\n","out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, \n","silver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender it \n","proved strong enough to bear many men. legolas ran lightly up, and frodo \n","followed slowly; behind came sam trying not to breathe loudly. the branches \n","of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept \n","upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or \n","flet as such things were called in those days: the elves called it a talan. \n","\n","it was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder \n","passed. \n","\n","when frodo came at last up on to the flet he found legolas seated with \n","three other elves. they were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen \n","among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. they stood up, and one of \n","them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. he held it \n","up, looking at frodo's face, and sam's. then he shut off the light again, \n","and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. frodo spoke haltingly in \n","return. \n","\n","'welcome!' the elf then said again in the common fanguage, speaking \n","slowly. 'we seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart \n","of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk. even \n","our own kindred in the north are sundered from us. but there are some of us \n","still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our \n","enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. i am one. haldir is my \n","name. my brothers, rmil and orophin, speak little of your tongue. \n","\n","'but we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of elrond \n","passed by furien on their way home up the dimrill stair. we had not heard of \n","hobbits, or halflings, for many a long year, and did not know that any yet \n","dwelt in middle-earth. you do not look evil! and since you come with an elf \n","of our kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as elrond asked; though it \n","is not our custom to lead strangers through our land. but you must stay here \n","tonight. how many are you? ' \n","\n","'eight,' said legolas. 'myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom, \n","aragorn, is an elf-friend of the folk of westernesse.' \n","\n","'the name of aragorn son of arathorn is known in lurien,' said haldir, \n","'and he has the favour of the lady. all then is well. but you have yet \n","spoken only of seven.' \n","\n","'the eighth is a dwarf,' said legolas. \n","\n","'a dwarf! ' said haldir. 'that is not well. we have not had dealings \n","with the dwarves since the dark days. they are not permitted in our land. i \n","cannot allow him to pass.' \n","\n","'but he is from the lonely mountain, one of dbin's trusty people, and \n","friendly to elrond,' said frodo. 'elrond himself chose him to be one of our \n","companions, and he has been brave and faithful.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned legolas in \n","their own tongue. 'very good,' said haldir at last. 'we will do this, though \n","it is against our liking. if aragorn and legolas will guard him, and answer \n","for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through lothlurien. \n","\n","'but now we must debate no longer. your folk must not remain on the \n","ground. we have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a great \n","troop of ores going north toward moria, along the skirts of the mountains, \n","many days ago. wolves are howling on the wood's borders. if you have indeed \n","come from moria, the peril cannot be far behind. tomorrow early you must go \n","on. \n","\n","'the four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us- we do not fear \n","them! there is another ta ian in the next tree. there the others must take \n","refuge. you, legolas, must answer to us for them. call us, if anything is \n","amiss! and have an eye on that dwarf!' \n","\n","legolas at once went down the ladder to take haldir's message; and soon \n","afterwards merry and pippin clambered up on to the high flet. they were out \n","of breath and seemed rather scared. \n","\n","'there!' said merry panting. 'we have lugged up your blankets as well \n","as our own. strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift \n","of leaves.' \n","\n","'you had no need of your burdens,' said haldir. 'it is cold in the \n","tree-tops in winter, though the wind tonight is in the south; but we have \n","food and drink to give you that will drive away the night-chill, and we have \n","skins and cloaks to spare.' \n","\n","the hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly. \n","\n","then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the \n","elves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to go to sleep. but \n","weary as they were only sam found that easy to do. hobbits do not like \n","heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. the flet \n","was not at all to their liking as a bedroom. it had no walls, not even a \n","rail; only on one side was there a light plaited screen, which could be \n","moved and fixed in different places according to the wind. \n","\n","pippin went on talking for a while. 'i hope, if i do go to sleep in \n","this bed-loft, that i shan't roll off,' he said. \n","\n","'once i do get to sleep,' said sam, 'i shall go on sleeping, whether i \n","roll off or no. and the less said, the sooner i'll drop off, if you take my \n","meaning.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting \n","through the pale roof of quivering leaves. sam was snoring at his side long \n","before he himself closed his eyes. he could dimly see the grey forms of two \n","elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking in \n","whispers. the other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower \n","branches. at last lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet \n","murmur of the falls of nimrodel below, frodo fell asleep with the song of \n","legolas running in his mind. \n","\n","late in the night he awoke. the other hobbits were asleep. the elves \n","were gone. the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. the wind \n","was \n","\n","still. a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on \n","the ground below. there was a ring of metal. the sounds died slowly away, \n","and seemed to go southward, on into the wood. \n","\n","a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. frodo sat up in \n","alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded elf. he looked towards the hobbits. \n","\n","'what is it? ' said frodo. \n","\n","' yrch !' said the elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the \n","rope-ladder rolled up. \n","\n","'ores! ' said frodo. 'what are they doing? ' but the elf had gone. \n","\n","there were no more sounds. even the leaves were silent, and the very \n","falls seemed to be hushed. frodo sat and shivered in his wraps. he was \n","thankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the \n","trees offered little protection, except concealment. ores were as keen as \n","hounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. he drew out \n","sting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded \n","again and grew dull. in spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of \n","immediate danger did not leave frodo, rather it grew stronger. he got up and \n","crawled to the opening and peered down. he was almost certain that he could \n","hear stealthy movements at the tree's foot far below. \n","\n","not elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their \n","movements. then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed \n","to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk. he stared down into the \n","dark, holding his breath. \n","\n","something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft \n","hissing through closed teeth. then coming up, close to the stem, frodo saw \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","two pale eyes. they stopped and gazed upward unwinking. suddenly they \n","turned \n","\n","away, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished. \n","\n","immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through the \n","branches. 'there was something in this tree that i have never seen before,' \n","he said. 'it was not an ore. it fled as soon as i touched the tree -stem. it \n","seemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or i might have thought \n","that it was one of you hobbits. \n","\n","i did not shoot, for i dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk \n","battle. a strong company of ores has passed. they crossed the nimrodel-curse \n","their foul feet in its clean water! -and went on down the old road beside the \n","river. they seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a \n","while near the place where you halted. the three of us could not challenge a \n","hundred, so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on \n","into the wood. \n","\n","'orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our \n","people. none of the ores will ever return out of lurien. and there will be \n","many elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls. but you \n","must take the road south as soon as it is fully light.' \n","\n","day came pale from the east. as the light grew it filtered through the \n","yellow leaves of the mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early \n","sun of a cool summer's morning was shining. pale-blue sky peeped among the \n","moving branches. looking through an opening on the south side of the flet \n","frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold \n","tossing gently in the breeze. \n","\n","the morning was still young and cold when the company set out again, \n","guided now by haldir and his brother rmil. 'farewell, sweet nimrodel! ' \n","cried legolas. frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among \n","the \n","\n","grey tree-stems. 'farewell,' he said. it seemed to him that he would never \n","hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable \n","notes in an endless changeful music. \n","\n","they went back to the path that still went on along the west side of \n","the silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward. there were the \n","prints of ore-feet in the earth. but soon haldir turned aside into the trees \n","and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows. \n","\n","'there is one of my people yonder across the stream,' he said 'though \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","you may not see him.' he gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out \n","of a thicket of young trees an elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood \n","thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. haldir skilfully \n","cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end \n","about a tree near the bank. \n","\n","'celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,' said haldir \n","'and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. we do not set foot in it \n","so far north, unless we must. but in these days of watchfulness we do not \n","make bridges. this is how we cross! follow me!' he made his end of the rope \n","fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and \n","back again, as if he were on a road. \n","\n","v i can walk this path,' said legolas; 'but the others have not this \n","skill. must they swim?' \n","\n","'no!' said haldir. 'we have two more ropes. we will fasten them above \n","the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and holding these the \n","strangers should be able to cross with care.' \n","\n","when this slender bridge had been made, the company passed over, some \n","cautiously and slowly, others more easily. of the hobbits pippin proved the \n","best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with \n","one hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. sam \n","shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water \n","as if it was a chasm in the mountains. \n","\n","he breathed with relief when he was safely across. 'live and learn! as \n","my gaffer used to say. though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting \n","like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. not even my uncle andy \n","ever did a trick like that! ' \n","\n","when at length all the company was gathered on the east bank of the \n","silverlode, the elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them. rmil, who \n","had remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it on his \n","shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to nimrodel to keep \n","watch. \n","\n","'now, friends,' said haldir, 'you have entered the naith of lurien or \n","the gore, as you would say, for it is the land that lies like a spear -head \n","between the arms of silverlode and anduin the great. we allow no strangers \n","to spy out the secrets of the naith. few indeed are permitted even to set \n","foot there. \n","\n","'as was agreed, i shall here blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf. the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","other may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down \n","in egladil, in the angle between the waters.' \n","\n","this was not at all to the liking of gimli. 'the agreement was made \n","without my consent,' he said. 'i will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a \n","prisoner. and i am no spy. my folk have never had dealings with any of the \n","servants of the enemy. neither have we done harm to the elves. i am no more \n","likely to betray you than legolas, or any other of my companions.' \n","\n","'i do not doubt you,' said haldir. 'yet this is our law. i am not the \n","master of the law, and cannot set it aside. i have done much in letting you \n","set foot over celebrant.' \n","\n","gimli was obstinate. he planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his \n","hand upon the haft of his axe. 'i will go forward free,' he said, 'or i will \n","go back and seek my own land, where i am known to be true of word, though i \n","perish alone in the wilderness.' \n","\n","'you cannot go back,' said haldir sternly. 'now you have come thus far, \n","you must be brought before the lord and the lady. they shall judge you, to \n","hold you or to give you leave, as they will. you cannot cross the rivers \n","again, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. \n","\n","you would be slain before you saw them.' \n","\n","gimli drew his axe from his belt. haldir and his companion bent their \n","bows. 'a plague on dwarves and their stiff necks! ' said legolas. \n","\n","'come!' said aragorn. 'if i am still to lead this company, you must do \n","as i bid. it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out. we will all be \n","blindfold, even legolas. that will be best, though it will make the journey \n","slow and dull.' \n","\n","gimli laughed suddenly. 'a merry troop of fools we shall look! will \n","haldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? but i \n","will be content, if only legolas here shares my blindness.' \n","\n","'i am an elf and a kinsman here,' said legolas, becoming angry in his \n","turn. \n","\n","'now let us cry: \"a plague on the stiff necks of elves!\"' said aragorn. \n","\n","'but the company shall all fare alike. come, bind our eyes haldir! ' \n","\n","'i shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do \n","not lead us well,' said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes. \n","\n","'you will have no claim,' said haldir. 'i shall lead you well, and the \n","paths are smooth and straight.' \n","\n","'alas for the folly of these days! ' said legolas. 'here all are \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","enemies of the one enemy, and yet i must walk blind, while the sun is merry \n","in the woodland under leaves of gold! ' \n","\n","'folly it may seem,' said haldir. 'indeed in nothing is the power of \n","the dark lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all \n","those who still oppose him. yet so little faith and trust do we find now in \n","the world beyond lothlurien, unless maybe in rivendell, that we dare not by \n","our own trust endanger our land. we live now upon an island amid many \n","perils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp. \n","\n","'the rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more for the \n","shadow has crept northward all about us. some speak of departing, yet for \n","that it already seems too late. the mountains to the west are growing evil; \n","to the east the lands are waste, and full of sauron's creatures; and it is \n","rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through rohan, and the \n","mouths of the great river are watched by the enemy. even if we could come \n","to \n","\n","the shores of the sea, we should find no longer any shelter there. it is \n","said that there are still havens of. the high elves, but they are far north \n","and west, beyond the land of the halflings. but where that may be, though \n","the lord and lady may know, i do not.' \n","\n","'you ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,' said merry. \n","\n","'there are elf-havens west of my land, the shire where hobbits live.' \n","\n","'happy folk are hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea! ' said \n","haldir. 'it is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still \n","we remember it in song. tell me of these havens as we walk.' \n","\n","'i cannot,' said merry. 'i have never seen them. i have never been out \n","of my own land before. and if i had known what the world outside was like. i \n","don't think i should have had the heart to leave it.' \n","\n","'not even to see fair lothlurien? ' said haldir. 'the world is indeed \n","full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much \n","that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it \n","grows perhaps the greater. \n","\n","'some there are among us who sing that the shadow will draw back and \n","peace shall come again. yet i do not believe that the world about us will \n","ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the sun as it was aforetime. \n","\n","for the elves, i fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass \n","to the sea unhindered and leave the middle-earth for ever. alas for \n","lothlurien that i love! it would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","grew. but if there are mallorn-trees beyond the great sea, none have \n","reported it.' \n","\n","as they spoke thus, the company filed slowly along the paths in the \n","wood, led by haldir, while the other elf walked behind. they felt the ground \n","beneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a while they walked more \n","freely, without fear of hurt or fall. being deprived of sight, frodo found \n","his hearing and other senses sharpened. he could smell the trees and the \n","trodden grass. he could hear many different notes in the rustle of the \n","leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right, and the thin clear \n","voices of birds in the sky. he felt the sun upon his face and hands when \n","they passed through an open glade. \n","\n","as soon as he set foot upon the far bank of silverlode a strange \n","feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the naith: \n","it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of \n","the elder days, and was -now walking in a world that was no more. in \n","rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in lurien the ancient things \n","still lived on in the waking world. evil had been seen and heard there, \n","sorrow had been known; the elves feared and distrusted the world outside: \n","wolves were howling on the wood's borders: but on the land of lurien no \n","shadow lay. \n","\n","all that day the company marched on, until they felt the cool evening \n","come and heard the early night- wind whispering among many leaves. then \n","they \n","\n","rested and slept without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not \n","permit them to unbind their eyes, and they could not climb. in the morning \n","they went on again, walking without haste. at noon they halted, and frodo \n","was aware that they had passed out under the shining sun. suddenly he heard \n","the sound of many voices all around him. \n","\n","a marching host of elves had come up silently: they were hastening \n","toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from moria; and they \n","brought news, some of which haldir reported. the marauding ores had been \n","waylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the \n","mountains, and were being pursued. a strange creature also had been seen, \n","running with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet \n","notofbeast-shape.lt had eluded capture, and they had not shot it, not \n","knowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished down the silverlode \n","southward. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'also,' said haldir, \"they bring me a message from the lord and lady of \n","the galadhrim. you are all to walk free, even the dwarf gimli. it seems that \n","the lady knows who and what is each member of your company. new \n","messages \n","\n","have come from rivendell perhaps.' \n","\n","he removed the bandage first from gimli' s eyes. 'your pardon! ' he \n","said, bowing low. \"look on us now with friendly eyes! look and be glad, for \n","you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the naith of lurien since \n","durin's day! ' \n","\n","when his eyes were in turn uncovered, frodo looked up and caught his \n","breath. they were standing in an open space. to the left stood a great \n","mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as spring-time in the elder \n","days. upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had \n","bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely \n","nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in \n","pale gold. high amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the \n","centre of all there gleamed a white flet. at the feet of the trees, and all \n","about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers \n","shaped like stars. among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other \n","flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue \n","of the grass. over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed \n","upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees. \n","\n","'behold! you are come to cerin amroth,' said haldir. \"for this is the \n","heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here is the mound of \n","amroth, where in happier days his high house was built. here ever bloom the \n","winter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow elanor, and the pale \n","niphredil. here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the galadhrim \n","at dusk.' \n","\n","the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but frodo \n","stood awhile still lost in wonder. it seemed to him that he had stepped \n","through a high window that looked on a vanished world. a light was upon it \n","for which his language had no name. all that he saw was shapely, but the \n","shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and \n","drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for \n","ever. he saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, \n","but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. in winter here \n","no \n","\n","heart could mourn for summer or for spring. no blemish or sickness or \n","deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. on the land of \n","lurien there was no stain. \n","\n","he turned and saw that sam was now standing beside him, looking round \n","with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that \n","he was awake. 'it's sunlight and bright day, right enough,' he said. 'i \n","thought that elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than \n","anything i ever heard tell of. i feel as if i was inside a song, if you take \n","my meaning.' \n","\n","haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both \n","thought and word. he smiled. 'you feel the power of the lady of the \n","galadhrim,' he said. 'would it please you to climb with me up cerin amroth? \n","\n","f \n","\n","they followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes. \n","though he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were \n","stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, frodo felt that he was in \n","a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. when \n","he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still frodo the wanderer \n","from the shire would walk there, upon the grass among elanor and niphredil \n","in fair lothlurien. \n","\n","they entered the circle of white trees. as they did so the south wind \n","blew upon cerin amroth and sighed among the branches. frodo stood still, \n","hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, \n","and sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth. \n","\n","haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. as frodo \n","prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: \n","never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and \n","texture of a tree's skin and of the life within it. he felt a delight in \n","wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the \n","delight of the living tree itself. \n","\n","as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, haldir took his hand \n","and turned him toward the south. 'look this way first! ' he said. \n","\n","frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty \n","trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. out of it, \n","it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","sway. he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. then \n","he looked eastward and saw all the land of lurien running down to the pale \n","gleam of anduin, the great river. he lifted his eyes across the river and \n","all the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew. beyond \n","the river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far \n","away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. the sun that lay on \n","lothlurien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height. \n","\n","'there lies the fastness of southern mirkwood,' said haldir. 'it is \n","clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and \n","their branches rot and wither. in the midst upon a stony height stands dol \n","guldur, where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling. we fear that now it is \n","inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. a black cloud lies often over it \n","of late. in this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one \n","to another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light \n","perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been \n","discovered. not yet.' he turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed \n","him. \n","\n","at the hill's foot frodo found aragorn, standing still and silent as a \n","tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in \n","his eyes. he was wrapped in some fair memory: and as frodo looked at him he \n","knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. for the \n","grim years were removed from the face of aragorn, and he seemed clothed in \n","white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the elvish tongue \n","to one whom frodo could not see. arwen vanimelda, nambril! he said, and then \n","he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo and \n","smiled. \n","\n","'here is the heart of elvendom on earth,' he said, 'and here my heart \n","dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still \n","must tread, you and i. come with me! ' and taking frodo's hand in his, he \n","left the hill of cerin amroth and came there never again as living man. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 7 . the mirror of galadriel \n","\n","\n","\n","the sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were \n","deepening in the woods, when they went on again. their paths now went into \n","thickets where the dusk had already gathered. night came beneath the trees \n","as they walked, and the elves uncovered their silver lamps. \n","\n","suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a \n","pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. there was a wide treeless \n","space before them, running in a great circle and bending away on either \n","hand. beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its \n","brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone. \n","upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a \n","green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in \n","all the land. their height could not be guessed, but they stood up in the \n","twilight like living towers. in their, many -tiered branches and amid their \n","ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and \n","silver. haldir turned towards the company. \n","\n","'welcome to caras galadhon! ' he said. 'here is the city of the \n","galadhrim where dwell the lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lurien. \n","but we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look northward. we must go \n","round to the southern side, and the way is not short, for the city is \n","great.' \n","\n","there was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of \n","the fosse. along this they went westward, with the city ever climbing up \n","like a green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened more lights \n","sprang forth, until all the hill seemed afire with stars. they came at last \n","to a white bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they \n","faced south-west, set between the ends of the encircling wall that here \n","overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps. \n","\n","haldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of \n","guards lrodo could see no sign. the travellers passed within, and the gates \n","shut behind them. they were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and \n","passing quickly through it they entered the city of the trees. no folk could \n","they see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices, \n","about them, and in the air above. ear away up on the hill they could hear \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves. \n","\n","they went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to \n","the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering. \n","it was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell \n","into a basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled. upon the south \n","side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great \n","smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first \n","branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves. \n","beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three elves were \n","seated. they sprang up as the travellers approached, and frodo saw that they \n","were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white \n","cloaks. \n","\n","'here dwell celeborn and galadriel,' said haldir. v it is their wish \n","that you should ascend and speak with them.' \n","\n","one of the elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it \n","was answered three times from far above. v i will go first,' said haldir. \n","\n","'let frodo come next and with him legolas. the others may follow as they \n","wish. it is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs, \n","but you may rest upon the way.' \n","\n","as he climbed slowly up frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some \n","on another, and some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder \n","passed through them. at a great height above the ground he came to a wide \n","talan, like the deck of a great ship. on it was built a house, so large that \n","almost it would have served for a hall of men upon the earth. he entered \n","behind haldir, and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the \n","midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its \n","crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth. \n","\n","the chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and \n","silver and its roof of gold. many elves were seated there. on two chairs \n","beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side \n","by side, celeborn and galadriel. they stood up to greet their guests, after \n","the manner of elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. very tall \n","they were, and the lady no less tall than the lord; and they were grave and \n","beautiful. they were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the lady was of \n","deep gold, and the hair of the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright; \n","but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their \n","eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","wells of deep memory. \n","\n","haldir led frodo before them, and the lord welcomed him in his own \n","tongue. the lady galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face. \n","\n","'sit now beside my chair, frodo of the shire! ' said celeborn. 'when \n","all have come we will speak together.' \n","\n","each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered. \n","'welcome aragorn son of arathorn! ' he said. 'it is eight and thirty years \n","of the world outside since you came to this land; and those years lie heavy \n","on you. but the end is near, for good or ill. here lay aside your burden for \n","a while ! ' \n","\n","'welcome son of thranduil! too seldom do my kindred journey hither from \n","the north.' \n","\n","'welcome gimli son of gluin! it is long indeed since we saw one of \n","durin's folk in caras galadhon. but today we have broken our long law. may \n","it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand, and \n","that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.' gimli bowed low. \n","\n","when all the guests were seated before his chair the lord looked at \n","them again. 'here there are eight,' he said. 'nine were to set out: so said \n","the messages. but maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have \n","not heard. elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this \n","year the shadows have grown longer.' \n","\n","'nay, there was no change of counsel,' said the lady galadriel speaking \n","for the first time. her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's \n","wont. 'gandalf the grey set out with the company, but he did not pass the \n","borders of this land. now tell us where he is; for i much desired to speak \n","with him again. but i cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the \n","fences of lothlurien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and \n","of his mind are hidden from me.' \n","\n","'alas! ' said aragorn. 'gandalf the grey fell into shadow. he remained \n","in moria and did not escape.' \n","\n","at these words all the elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and \n","amazement. 'these are evil tidings,' said celeborn, 'the most evil that have \n","been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.' he turned to haldir. \n","'why has nothing of this been told to me before? ' he asked in the \n","elven-tongue. \n","\n","'we have not spoken to haldir of our deeds or our purpose,' said \n","legolas. 'at first we were weary and danger was too close behind and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness \n","on the fair paths of lurien.' \n","\n","'yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,' said frodo. \n","'gandalf was our guide, and he led us through moria; and when our escape \n","seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.' \n","\n","tell us now the full tale! ' said celeborn: \n","\n","then aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of \n","caradhras, and in the days that followed; and he spoke of balin and his \n","book, and the fight in the chamber of mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow \n","bridge, and the coming of the terror. 'an evil of the ancient world it \n","seemed, such as i have never seen before,' said aragorn. 'it was both a \n","shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.' \n","\n","'it was a balrog of morgoth,' said legolas; 'of all elf-banes the most \n","deadly, save the one who sits in the dark tower.' \n","\n","'indeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams 1 \n","saw durin's bane,' said gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes. \n","\n","'alas! ' said celeborn. 'we long have feared that under caradhras a \n","terror slept. but had i known that the dwarves had stirred up this evil in \n","moria again, 1 would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders, you \n","and all that went with you. and if it were possible, one would say that at \n","the last gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net \n","of moria.' \n","\n","'he would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said galadriel gravely. \n","'needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life. those that followed him \n","knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose. but however it may be \n","with the guide, the followers are blameless. do not repent of your welcome \n","to the dwarf. if our folk had been exiled long and far from lothlurien, who \n","of the galadhrim, even celeborn the wise, would pass nigh and would not \n","wish \n","\n","to look upon their ancient home, though it had become an abode of dragons? \n","\n","'dark is the water of kheled-zvram, and cold are the springs of \n","kibil-nvla, and fair were the many -pillared halls of khazad-dym in elder \n","days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone.' she looked upon \n","gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. and the dwarf, hearing the \n","names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it \n","seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw \n","there love and understanding. wonder came into his face, and then he smiled \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","in answer. \n","\n","he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: 'yet more fair is \n","the living land of lurien, and the lady galadriel is above all the jewels \n","that lie beneath the earth! ' \n","\n","there was a silence. at length celeborn spoke again. 'i did not know \n","that your plight was so evil,' he said. 'let gimli forget my harsh words: i \n","spoke in the trouble of my heart. i will do what i can to aid you, each \n","according to his wish and need, but especially that one of the little folk \n","who bears the burden.' \n","\n","'your quest is known to us,' said galadriel, looking at frodo. 'but we \n","will not here speak of it more openly. yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, \n","that you came to this land seeking aid, as gandalf himself plainly purposed. \n","for the lord of the galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the elves of \n","middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. he has dwelt \n","in the west since the days of dawn, and i have dwelt with him years \n","uncounted; for ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over the \n","mountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought the long \n","defeat. \n","\n","'i it was who first summoned the white council. and if my designs had \n","not gone amiss, it would have been governed by gandalf the grey, and then \n","mayhap things would have gone otherwise. but even now there is hope left. i \n","will not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that. for not in doing or \n","contriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can i avail; \n","but only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be. but \n","this i will say to you: your quest stands upon the edge of a knife. stray \n","but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. yet hope remains while \n","all the company is true.' \n","\n","and with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked \n","searchingly at each of them in turn. none save legolas and aragorn could \n","long endure her glance. sam quickly blushed and hung his head. \n","\n","at length the lady galadriel released them from her eyes, and she \n","smiled. 'do not let your hearts be troubled,' she said. 'tonight you shall \n","sleep in peace.' then they sighed and felt suddenly weary, as those who have \n","been questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken openly. \n","\n","'go now! ' said celeborn. 'you are worn with sorrow and much toil. even \n","if your quest did not concern us closely, you should have refuge in this \n","city, until you were healed and refreshed. now you shall rest, and we will \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","not speak of your further road for a while.' \n","\n","that night the company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction \n","of the hobbits. the elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near \n","the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace \n","with fair elvish voices they left them. for a little while the travellers \n","talked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day's journey, \n","and of the lord and lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further \n","back. \n","\n","'what did you blush for, sam? ' said pippin. 'you soon broke down. \n","anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. i hope it was nothing \n","worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets.' \n","\n","'i never thought no such thing,' answered sam, in no mood for jest. 'if \n","you want to know, i felt as if i hadn't got nothing on, and i didn't like \n","it. she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what i would do if she \n","gave me the chance of flying back home to the shire to a nice little hole \n","with-with a bit of garden of my own.' \n","\n","'that's funny,' said merry. 'almost exactly what i felt myself; only, \n","only well, i don't think i'll say any more,' he ended lamely. \n","\n","all of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was \n","offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something \n","that he greatly desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had \n","only to turn aside from the road and leave the quest and the war against \n","sauron to others. \n","\n","'and it seemed to me, too,' said gimli, 'that my choice would remain \n","secret and known only to myself.' \n","\n","'to me it seemed exceedingly strange,' said boromir. 'maybe it was only \n","a test, and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose; but \n","almost i should have said that she was tempting us, and offering what she \n","pretended to have the power to give. it need not be said that i refused to \n","listen. the men of minas tirith are true to their word.' but what he thought \n","that the lady had offered him boromir did not tell. \n","\n","and as for frodo, he would not speak, though boromir pressed him with \n","questions. 'she held you long in her gaze, ring -bearer,' he said. \n","\n","'yes,' said frodo; 'but whatever came into my mind then i will keep \n","there.' \n","\n","'well, have a care! 'said boromir. 'i do not feel too sure of this \n","elvish lady and her purposes.' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'speak no evil of the lady galadriel! ' said aragorn sternly. 'you know \n","not what you say. there is in her and in this land no evil, unless a man \n","bring it hither himself . then let him beware ! but tonight i shall sleep \n","without fear for the first time since i left rivendell. and may i sleep \n","deep, and forget for a while my grief! i am weary in body and in heart.' he \n","cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep. \n","\n","the others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their \n","slumber. when they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the \n","lawn before the pavilion, and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the \n","sun. \n","\n","they remained some days in lothlurien, so far as they could tell or \n","remember. all the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear, save for \n","a gentle rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all things fresh \n","and clean. the air was cool and soft, as if it were early spring, yet they \n","felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter. it seemed to them \n","that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees; \n","and it was enough. \n","\n","they had not seen the lord and lady again, and they had little speech \n","with the elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the westron tongue. \n","haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the \n","north, where great watch was now kept since the tidings of moria that the \n","company had brought. legolas was away much among the galadhrim, and \n","after \n","\n","the first night he did not sleep with the other companions, though he \n","returned to eat and talk with them. often he took gimli with him when he \n","went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change. \n","\n","now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of gandalf, and \n","all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds. as \n","they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew \n","more keen. often they heard nearby elvish voices singing, and knew that they \n","were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name \n","among the sweet sad words that they could not understand. \n","\n","mithrandir, mithrandir sang the elves, o pilgrim grey! for so they \n","loved to call him. but if legolas was with the company, he would not \n","interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for \n","him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song. \n","\n","it was frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in ri vendell he had \n","listened \n","\n","and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that \n","others had made before him. but now as he sat beside the fountain in lurien \n","and heard about him the voices of the elves, his thought took shape in a \n","song that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to sam only \n","snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered leaves. \n","\n","when evening in the shire was grey \n","his footsteps on the hill were heard; \n","before the dawn he went away \n","on journey long without a word. \n","\n","from wilderland to western shore, \n","from northern waste to southern hill, \n","through dragon-lair and hidden door \n","and darkling woods he walked at will. \n","\n","with dwarf and hobbit, elves and men, \n","with mortal and immortal folk, \n","with bird on bough and beast in den, \n","in their own secret tongues he spoke. \n","\n","a deadly sword, a healing hand, \n","a back that bent beneath its load; \n","a trumpet-voice, a burning brand, \n","a weary pilgrim on the road. \n","\n","a lord of wisdom throned he sat, \n","swift in anger, quick to laugh; \n","an old man in a battered hat \n","who leaned upon a thorny staff. \n","\n","he stood upon the bridge alone \n","and fire and shadow both defied; \n","his staff was broken on the stone, \n","in khazad-dym his wisdom died. \n","\n","'why, you'll be beating mr. bilbo next! ' said sam. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'no, i am afraid not,' said frodo. 'but that is the best i can do yet.' \n","\n","'well, mr. frodo, if you do have another go, i hope you'll say a word \n","about his fireworks,' said sam. 'something like this: \n","\n","the finest rockets ever seen: \n","they burst in stars of blue and green, \n","or after thunder golden showers \n","came falling like a rain of flowers. \n","\n","though that doesn't do them justice by a long road.' \n","\n","'no, i'll leave that to you, sam. or perhaps to bilbo. but-well. i \n","can't talk of it any more. i can't bear to think of bringing the news to \n","him.' \n","\n","one evening frodo and sam were walking together in the cool twilight. \n","both of them felt restless again. on frodo suddenly the shadow of parting \n","had fallen: he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave \n","lothlurien. \n","\n","'what do you think of elves now, sam? ' he said. 'i asked you the same \n","question once before-it seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more \n","of them since then.' \n","\n","'i have indeed! ' said sam. 'and i reckon there's elves and elves. \n","\n","they're all elvish enough, but they're not all the same. now these folk \n","aren't wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they \n","seem to belong here, more even than flobbits do in the shire. whether they've \n","made the land, or the land's made them, it's hard to say, if you take my \n","meaning. it's wonderfully quiet here. nothing seems to be going on, and \n","nobody seems to want it to. if there's any magic about, it's right down \n","deep, where i can't lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.' \n","\n","'you can see and feel it everywhere,' said frodo. \n","\n","'well,' said sam, 'you can't see nobody working it. no fireworks like \n","poor gandalf used to show. i wonder we don't see nothing of the lord and \n","lady in all these days. i fancy now that she could do some wonderful things, \n","if she had a mind. i'd dearly love to see some elf-magic, mr. frodo! ' \n","\n","'i wouldn't,' said frodo. 'i am content. and i don't miss gandalf's \n","fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.' \n","\n","'you're right,' said sam. 'and don't think i'm finding fault. i've \n","often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but \n","i've never heard of a better land than this. it's like being at home and on \n","a holiday at the same time, if you understand me. i don't want to leave. all \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the same, i'm beginning to feel that if we've got to go on, then we'd best \n","get it over. \n","\n","'it's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish, as my \n","old gaffer used to say. and i don't reckon that these folk can do much more \n","to help us, magic or no. it's when we leave this land that we shall miss \n","gandalf worse, i'm thinking.' \n","\n","'i am afraid that's only too true, sam,' said frodo. 'yet i hope very \n","much that before we leave we shall see the lady of the elves again.' \n","\n","even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words, \n","the lady galadriel approaching. tall and white and fair she walked beneath \n","the trees. she spoke no word, but beckoned to them. \n","\n","turning aside, she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of \n","caras galadhon, and passing through a high green hedge they came into an \n","enclosed garden. no trees grew there, and it lay open to the sky. the \n","evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western \n","woods. down a long flight of steps the lady went into a deep green hollow, \n","through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain \n","on the hill. at the bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching \n","tree, stood a basin of silver, wide and shallow, and beside it stood a \n","silver ewer. \n","\n","with water from the stream galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and \n","breathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke. 'here is the \n","mirror of galadriel,' she said. 'i have brought you here so that you may \n","look in it, if you will.' \n","\n","the air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the elf-lady beside \n","him was tall and pale. 'what shall we look for, and what shall we see? ' \n","asked frodo, filled with awe. \n","\n","'many things i can command the mirror to reveal,' she answered, 'and to \n","some i can show what they desire to see. but the mirror will also show \n","things unbidden, and those are often stranger and more profitable than \n","things which we wish to behold. what you will see, if you leave the mirror \n","free to work, i cannot tell. for it shows things that were, and things that \n","are, things that yet may be. but which it is that he sees, even the wisest \n","cannot always tell. do you wish to look? ' \n","\n","frodo did not answer. \n","\n","'and you? ' she said, turning to sam. 'for this is what your folk would \n","call magic. i believe; though i do not understand clearly what they mean; \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the enemy. but \n","this, if you will, is the magic of galadriel. did you not say that you \n","wished to see elf-magic? ' \n","\n","'i did,' said sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity. til \n","have a peep, lady, if you're willing.' \n","\n","'and i'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home,' he said in an \n","aside to frodo. 'it seems a terrible long time that i've been away. but \n","there, like as not i'll only see the stars, or something that i won't \n","understand.' \n","\n","'like as not,' said the lady with a gentle laugh. 'but come, you shall \n","look and see what you may. do not touch the water! ' \n","\n","sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. \n","\n","the water looked hard and dark. stars were reflected in it. \n","\n","'there's only stars, as i thought,' he said. then he gave a low gasp, \n","for the stars went out. as if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the mirror \n","grew grey, and then clear. there was sun shining, and the branches of trees \n","were waving and tossing in the wind. but before sam could make up his mind \n","what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw frodo \n","with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. then he seemed \n","to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding \n","stair. it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, \n","but what it was he did not know. like a dream the vision shifted and went \n","back, and he saw the trees again. but this time they were not so close, and \n","he could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were \n","falling, crashing to the ground. \n","\n","'hi!' cried sam in an outraged voice. 'there's that ted sandyman \n","a-cutting down trees as he shouldn't. they didn't ought to be felled: it's \n","that avenue beyond the mill that shades the road to bywater. i wish i could \n","get at ted, and i'd fell himv \n","\n","but now sam noticed that the old mill had vanished, and a large \n","red-brick building was being put up where it had stood. lots of folk were \n","busily at work. there was a tall red chimney nearby. black smoke seemed to \n","cloud the surface of the mirror. \n","\n","'there's some devilry at work in the shire,' he said. 'elrond knew what \n","he was about when he wanted to send mr. merry back.' then suddenly sam \n","gave \n","\n","a cry and sprang away. 'i can't stay here,' he said wildly. 'i must go home. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","they've dug up bagshot row, and there's the poor old gaffer going down the \n","hill with his bits of things on a barrow. i must go home! ' \n","\n","'you cannot go home alone,' said the lady. 'you did not wish to go home \n","without your master before you looked in the mirror, and yet you knew that \n","evil things might well be happening in the shire. remember that the mirror \n","shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. some never come to be, \n","unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent \n","them. the mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.' \n","\n","sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. 'i wish i had \n","never come here, and i don't want to see no more magic,' he said and fell \n","silent. after a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. \n","\n","'no, i'll go home by the long road with mr. frodo, or not at all,' he said. \n","\n","'but i hope i do get back some day. if what i've seen turns out true, \n","somebody's going to catch it hot! ' \n","\n","'do you now wish to look, frodo? ' said the lady galadriel. 'you did \n","not wish to see elf-magic and were content.' \n","\n","'do you advise me to look? ' asked frodo. \n","\n","'no,' she said. 'i do not counsel you one way or the other. i am not a \n","counsellor. you may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or \n","evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not. seeing is both good and \n","perilous. yet i think, frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for \n","the venture, or i would not have brought you here. do as you will! ' \n","\n","'i will look,' said frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over \n","the dark water. at once the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land. \n","mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. a long grey road \n","wound back out of sight. far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint \n","and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached. \n","suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf. he almost called \n","aloud the wizard's name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in \n","grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its \n","hand there was a white staff. the head was so bowed that he could see no \n","face, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and \n","went out of the mirror's view. doubt came into frodo's mind: was this a \n","vision of gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it \n","saruman? \n","\n","the vision now changed. brief and small but very vivid he caught a \n","glimpse of bilbo walking restlessly about his room. the table was littered \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","with disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows. \n","\n","then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that \n","frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become \n","involved. the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before \n","but knew at once: the sea. darkness fell. the sea rose and raged in a great \n","storm. then he saw against the sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of \n","clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of \n","the west. then a wide river flowing through a populous city. then a white \n","fortress with seven towers. and then again a ship with black sails, but now \n","it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing \n","the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. a smoke as of fire and battle \n","arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey \n","mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. it \n","vanished, and frodo sighed and prepared to draw away. \n","\n","but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had \n","opened in the world of sight, and frodo looked into emptiness. in the black \n","abyss there appeared a single eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly \n","all the mirror. so terrible was it that frodo stood rooted, unable to cry \n","out or to withdraw his gaze. the eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself \n","glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its \n","pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing. \n","\n","then the eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and frodo knew \n","with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he \n","himself was one. but he also knew that it could not see him-not yet, not \n","unless he willed it. the ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew \n","heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. the \n","mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the \n","water. he was slipping forward. \n","\n","'do not touch the water!' said the lady galadriel softly. the vision \n","faded, and frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in \n","the silver basin. he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady. \n","\n","v i know what it was that you last saw,' she said; 'for that is also in \n","my mind. do not be afraid! but do not think that only by singing amid the \n","trees, nor even by the slender arrows of elven-bows, is this land of \n","lothlurien maintained and defended against its enemy. i say to you, frodo, \n","that even as i speak to you, i perceive the dark lord and know his mind, or \n","all of his mind that concerns the elves. and he gropes ever to see me and my \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","thought. but still the door is closed! ' \n","\n","she lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the east \n","in a gesture of rejection and denial. edrendil, the evening star, most \n","beloved of the elves, shone clear above. so bright was it that the figure of \n","the elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. its rays glanced upon a ring \n","about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver \n","light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the even-star had come down to \n","rest upon her hand. frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed \n","to him that he understood. \n","\n","'yes,' she said, divining his thought, 'it is not permitted to speak of \n","it, and elrond could not do so. but it cannot be hidden from the \n","ring -bearer, and one who has seen the eye. verily it is in the land of \n","lurien upon the finger of galadriel that one of the three remains. this is \n","nenya, the ring of adamant, and i am its keeper. \n","\n","'he suspects, but he does not know - not yet. do you not see now \n","wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of doom? for if you fail, \n","then we are laid bare to the enemy. yet if you succeed, then our power is \n","diminished, and lothlurien will fade, and the tides of time will sweep it \n","away. we must depart into the west, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and \n","cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.' \n","\n","frodo bent his head. 'and what do you wish? ' he said at last. \n","\n","'that what should be shall be,' she answered. 'the love of the elves \n","for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the sea, and \n","their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. yet they will \n","cast all away rather than submit to sauron: for they know him now. for the \n","fate of lothlurien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own \n","task. yet i could wish, were it of any avail, that the one ring had never \n","been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.' \n","\n","'you are wise and fearless and fair, lady galadriel,' said frodo. 'i \n","will give you the one ring, if you ask for it. it is too great a matter for \n","me.' \n","\n","galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. 'wise the lady galadriel \n","may be,' she said, 'yet here she has met her match in courtesy. gently are \n","you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. you begin to \n","see with a keen eye. i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask \n","what you offer. for many long years i had pondered what i might do, should \n","the great ring come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","grasp. the evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways, whether \n","sauron himself stands or falls. would not that have been a noble deed to set \n","to the credit of his ring, if i had taken it by force or fear from my guest? \n","\n","'and now at last it comes. you will give me the ring freely! in place \n","of the dark lord you will set up a queen. and i shall not be dark, but \n","beautiful and terrible as the morning and the night! fair as the sea and the \n","sun and the snow upon the mountain! dreadful as the storm and the \n","lightning ! \n","\n","stronger than the foundations of the earth. all shall love me and despair! ' \n","\n","she lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a \n","great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark. she stood \n","before frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond \n","enduring, terrible and worshipful. then she let her hand fall, and the light \n","faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender \n","elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad. \n","\n","'i pass the test,' she said. 'i will diminish, and go into the west and \n","remain galadriel.' \n","\n","they stood for a long while in silence. at length the lady spoke again. \n","\n","'let us return! ' she said. 'in the morning you must depart for now we have \n","chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.' \n","\n","'i would ask one thing before we go,' said frodo, 'a thing which i \n","often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell. i am permitted to wear the one \n","ring: why cannot i see all the others and know the thoughts of those that \n","wear them? ' \n","\n","'you have not tried,' she said. 'only thrice have you set the ring upon \n","your finger since you knew what you possessed. do not try! it would destroy \n","you. did not gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the \n","measure of each possessor? before you could use that power you would need \n","to \n","\n","become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. yet \n","even so, as ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that \n","which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. you have perceived my thought \n","more clearly than many that are accounted wise. you saw the eye of him that \n","holds the seven and the nine. and did you not see and recognize the ring \n","upon my finger? did you see my ring? ' she asked turning again to sam. \n","\n","'no, lady,' he answered. 'to tell you the truth, i wondered what you \n","were talking about. i saw a star through your finger. but if you'll pardon \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","my speaking out, i think my master was right. i wish you'd take his ring. \n","you'd put things to rights. you'd stop them digging up the gaffer and \n","turning him adrift. you'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.' \n","\n","'i would,' she said. 'that is how it would begin. but it would not stop \n","with that, alas! we will not speak more of it. let us go!' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 8 . farewell to lurien \n","\n","\n","\n","that night the company was again summoned to the chamber of celeborn, \n","and there the lord and lady greeted them with fair words. at length celeborn \n","spoke of their departure. \n","\n","'now is the time,' he said, 'when those who wish to continue the quest \n","must harden their hearts to leave this land. those who no longer wish to go \n","forward may remain here, for a while. but whether they stay or go, none can \n","be sure of peace. for we are come now to the edge of doom. here those who \n","wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world \n","lie open again, or we summon them to the last need of lurien. then they may \n","return to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in \n","battle.' \n","\n","there was a silence. 'they all resolved to go forward,' said galadriel \n","looking in their eyes. \n","\n","'as for me,' said boromir, 'my way home lies onward and not back.' \n","\n","'that is true,' said celeborn, 'but is all this company going with you \n","to minas tirith? ' \n","\n","'we have not decided our course,' said aragorn. 'beyond lothlurien i do \n","not know what gandalf intended to do. indeed i do not think that even he had \n","any clear purpose.' \n","\n","'maybe not,' said celeborn, 'yet when you leave this land, you can no \n","longer forget the great river. as some of you know well, it cannot be \n","crossed by travellers with baggage between lurien and gondor, save by boat. \n","and are not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and all the landings held \n","now by the enemy? \n","\n","'on which side will you journey? the way to minas tirith lies upon this \n","side, upon the west; but the straight road of the quest lies east of the \n","river, upon the darker shore. which shore will you now take? ' \n","\n","'if my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to \n","minas tirith,' answered boromir. 'but i am not the leader of the company.' \n","the others said nothing, and aragorn looked doubtful and troubled. \n","\n","'i see that you do not yet know what to do,' said celeborn. 'it is not \n","my part to choose for you; but i will help you as i may. there are some \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","among you who can handle boats: legolas, whose folk know the swift forest \n","river; and boromir of gondor; and aragorn the traveller.' \n","\n","'and one hobbit! ' cried merry. 'not all of us look on boats as wild \n","horses. my people live by the banks of the brandywine.' \n","\n","'that is well,' said celeborn. 'then i will furnish your company with \n","boats. they must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are \n","places where you will be forced to carry them. you will come to the rapids \n","of sarn gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of rauros where the \n","river thunders down from nen hithoel; and there are other perils. boats may \n","make your journey less toilsome for awhile. yet they will not give you \n","counsel: in the end you must leave them and the river, and turn west-or \n","east.' \n","\n","aragorn thanked celeborn many times. the gift of boats comforted him \n","much, not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for \n","some days. the others, too, looked more hopeful. whatever perils lay ahead, \n","it seemed better to float down the broad tide of anduin to meet them than to \n","plod forward with bent backs. only sam was doubtful: he at any rate still \n","thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that \n","he had survived made him think better of them. \n","\n","'all shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon \n","tomorrow,' said celeborn. 'i will send my people to you in the morning to \n","help you make ready for the journey. now we will wish you all a fair night \n","and untroubled sleep.' \n","\n","'good night, my friends! ' said galadriel. 'sleep in peace! do not \n","trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight. maybe the \n","paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though \n","you do not see them. good night! ' \n","\n","the company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion. \n","legolas went with them, for this was to be their last night in lothlurien, \n","and in spite of the words of galadriel they wished to take counsel together. \n","\n","for a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be \n","best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the ring: but they came \n","to no decision. it was plain that most of them desired to go first to minas \n","tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the enemy. \n","\n","they would have been willing to follow a leader over the river and into the \n","shadow of mordor; but frodo spoke no word, and aragorn was still divided in \n","his mind. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","his own plan, while gandalf remained with them, had been to go with \n","boromir, and with his sword help to deliver gondor. for he believed that the \n","message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last \n","when \n","\n","the heir of elendil should come forth and strive with sauron for the \n","mastery. but in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid on him; and he \n","knew that he could not now forsake the ring, if frodo refused in the end to \n","go with boromir. and yet what help could he or any of the company give to \n","frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness? \n","\n","'i shall go to minas tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said \n","boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes \n","fixed on frodo, as if he was trying to read the halfling's thoughts. at \n","length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. 'if you \n","wish only to destroy the ring,' he said, \"then there is little use in war \n","and weapons; and the men of minas tirith cannot help. but if you wish to \n","destroy the armed might of the dark lord, then it is folly to go without \n","force into his domain; and folly to throw away.' he paused suddenly, as if \n","he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. 'it would be \n","folly to throw lives away, i mean,' he ended. 'it is a choice between \n","defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death. at \n","least, that is how i see it.' \n","\n","frodo caught something new and strange in boromir's glance, and he \n","looked hard at him. plainly boromir's thought was different from his final \n","words. it would be folly to throw away: what? the ring of power? he had said \n","something like this at the council, but then he had accepted the correction \n","of elrond. frodo looked at aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought \n","and made no sign that he had heeded boromir's words. and so their debate \n","ended. merry and pippin were already asleep, and sam was nodding. the \n","night \n","\n","was growing old. \n","\n","in the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, \n","\n","elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts \n","of food and clothing for the journey. the food was mostly in the form of \n","very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, \n","and inside was the colour of cream. gimli took up one of the cakes and \n","looked at it with a doubtful eye. \n","\n","'cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","nibbled at it. his expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of \n","the cake with relish. \n","\n","'no more, no more!' cried the elves laughing. 'you have eaten enough \n","already for a long day's march.' \n","\n","'i thought it was only a kind of cram , such as the dale-men make for \n","journeys in the wild,' said the dwarf. \n","\n","'so it is,' they answered. 'but we call it lembas or waybread, and it \n","is more strengthening than any food made by men, and it is more pleasant \n","than cram, by all accounts.' \n","\n","'indeed it is,' said gimli. 'why it is better than the honey-cakes of \n","the beornings, and that is great praise, for the beornings are the best \n","bakers that i know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes \n","to travellers in these days. you are kindly hosts! ' \n","\n","'all the same, we bid you spare the food,' they said. 'eat little at a \n","time, and only at need. for these things are given to serve you when all \n","else fails. the cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are \n","unbroken and left in their leaf- wrappings, as we have brought them. one will \n","keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of \n","the tall men of minas tirith.' \n","\n","the elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the company the clothes \n","they had brought. for each they had provided a hood and cloak, made \n","according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the galadhrim \n","wove. it was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of \n","twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or \n","set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow \n","fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars. each cloak was \n","fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver. \n","\n","'are these magic cloaks? ' asked pippin, looking at them with wonder. \n","\n","'i do not know what you mean by that,' answered the leader of the \n","elves. 'they are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this \n","land. they are elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. leaf and \n","branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things \n","under the twilight of lurien that we love; for we put the thought of all \n","that we love into all that we make. yet they are garments, not armour, and \n","they will not turn shaft or blade. but they should serve you well: they are \n","light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. and you will find \n","them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","walk among the stones or the trees. you are indeed high in the favour of the \n","lady! for she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have \n","we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.' \n","\n","after their morning meal the company said farewell to the lawn by the \n","fountain. their hearts were heavy; for it was a fair place, and it had \n","become like home to them, though they could not count the days and nights \n","that they had passed there. as they stood for a moment looking at the white \n","water in the sunlight, haldir came walking towards them over the green grass \n","of the glade. frodo greeted him with delight. \n","\n","'i have returned from the northern fences,' said the elf, 'and i am \n","sent now to be your guide again. the dimrill dale is full of vapour and \n","clouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled. there are noises in the \n","deeps of the earth. if any of you had thought of returning northwards to \n","your homes, you would not have been able to pass that way. but come! your \n","path now goes south.' \n","\n","as they walked through caras galadhon the green ways were empty; but in \n","the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing. they \n","themselves \n","\n","went silently. at last haldir led them down the southward slopes of the \n","hill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the \n","white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the elves. then \n","they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a \n","deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding through rolling \n","woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and \n","eastwards, towards the shores of the river. \n","\n","they had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a \n","high green wall. passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the \n","trees. before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden \n","elanor that glinted in the sun. the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue \n","between bright margins: on the right and west the silverlode flowed \n","glittering; on the left and east the great river rolled its broad waters, \n","deep and dark. on the further shores the woodlands still marched on \n","southwards as far as the eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and \n","bare. no mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the land of lurien. \n","\n","on the bank of the silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of \n","the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white wood. by it were \n","moored many boats and barges. some were brightly painted, and shone with \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey. three small \n","grey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the elves \n","stowed their goods. and they added also coils of rope, three to each boat. \n","slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the \n","elven-cloaks. \n","\n","'what are these? ' asked sam, handling one that lay upon the \n","greensward. \n","\n","'ropes indeed! ' answered an elf from the boats. 'never travel far \n","without a rope! and one that is long and strong and light. such are these. \n","they may be a help in many needs.' \n","\n","'you don't need to tell me that! ' said sam. i came without any and \n","i've been worried ever since. but i was wondering what these were made of, \n","knowing a bit about rope -making: it's in the family as you might say.' \n","\n","'they are made of hithlain,' said the elf, 'but there is no time now to \n","instruct you in the art of their making. had we known that this craft \n","delighted you, we could have taught you much. but now alas! unless you \n","should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. may it \n","serve you well ! ' \n","\n","'come! ' said haldir. 'all is now ready for you. enter the boats! but \n","take care at first! ' \n","\n","'heed the words! ' said the other elves. 'these boats are light-built, \n","and they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk. they will not sink, \n","lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. it would be wise \n","if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a \n","landing-place, before you set off downstream.' \n","\n","the company was arranged in this way: aragorn, frodo, and sam were in \n","one boat; boromir, merry, and pippin in another; and in the third were \n","legolas and gimli, who had now become fast friends. in this last boat most \n","of the goods and packs were stowed. the boats were moved and steered with \n","short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. when all was ready \n","aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlode. the current was swift and \n","they went forward slowly. sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and \n","looking back wistfully to the shore. the sunlight glittering on the water \n","dazzled his eyes. as they passed beyond the green field of the tongue, the \n","trees drew down to the river's brink. here and there golden leaves tossed \n","and floated on the rippling stream. the air was very bright and still, and \n","there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","they turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly down \n","the stream toward them, they saw a swan of great size. the water rippled on \n","either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. its beak shone \n","like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its \n","huge white wings were half lifted. a music came down the river as it drew \n","nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved \n","with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. two elves clad in white steered \n","it with black paddles. in the midst of the vessel sat celeborn, and behind \n","him stood galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her \n","hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang. sad and sweet was the \n","sound of her voice in the cool clear air: \n","\n","i sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew: \n","\n","of wind i sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew. \n","\n","beyond the sun, beyond the moon, the foam was on the sea, \n","\n","and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden tree. \n","\n","beneath the stars of ever-eve in eldamar it shone, \n","\n","in eldamar beside the walls of elven tirion. \n","\n","there long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years, \n","\n","while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven-tears. \n","\n","o lurien! the winter comes, the bare and leafless day; \n","\n","the leaves are falling in the stream, the river flows away. \n","\n","o lurien! too long i have dwelt upon this hither shore \n","and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor. \n","\n","but if of ships i now should sing, what ship would come to me, \n","\n","what ship would bear me ever back across so wide a sea? \n","\n","aragorn stayed his boat as the swan-ship drew alongside. the lady ended \n","her song and greeted them. 'we have come to bid you our last farewell,' she \n","said, 'and to speed you with blessings from our land.' \n","\n","'though you have been our guests,' said celeborn, 'you have not yet \n","eaten with us, and we bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between \n","the flowing waters that will bear you far from lurien.' \n","\n","the swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and \n","followed it. there in the last end of egladil upon the green grass the \n","parting feast was held; but frodo ate and drank little, heeding only the \n","beauty of the lady and her voice. she seemed no longer perilous or terrible, \n","nor filled with hidden power. already she seemed to him, as by men of later \n","days elves still at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of \n","time. \n","\n","after they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, celeborn spoke \n","to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the \n","woods beyond the tongue. \n","\n","'as you go down the water,' he said, 'you will find that the trees will \n","fail, and you will come to a barren country. there the river flows in stony \n","vale amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall \n","island of the tindrock, that we call tol brandir. there it casts its arms \n","about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and \n","smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf, the wetwang as it \n","is called in your tongue. that is a wide region of sluggish fen where the \n","stream becomes tortuous and much divided. there the entwash flows in by \n","many \n","\n","mouths from the forest of fangorn in the west. about that stream, on this \n","side of the great river, lies rohan. on the further side are the bleak hills \n","of the emyn muil. the wind blows from the east there, for they look out over \n","the dead marshes and the noman-lands to cirith gorgor and the black gates of \n","mordor. \n","\n","'boromir, and any that go with him seeking minas tirith, will do well \n","to leave the great river above rauros and cross the entwash before it finds \n","the marshes. yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk \n","becoming entangled in the forest of fangorn. that is a strange land, and is \n","now little known. but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this \n","warning.' \n","\n","'indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith,' said boromir. 'but \n","what i have heard seems to me for the most part old wives' tales, such as we \n","tell to our children. all that lies north of rohan is now to us so far away \n","that fancy can wander freely there. of old fangorn lay upon the borders of \n","our realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it, to \n","prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years. \n","\n","'i have myself been at whiles in rohan, but i have never crossed it \n","northwards. when i was sent out as a messenger, i passed through the gap by \n","the skirts of the white mountains, and crossed the isen and the grey flood \n","into northerland. a long and wearisome journey. four hundred leagues i \n","reckoned it, and it took me many months; for i lost my horse at tharbad, at \n","the fording of the greyflood. after that journey, and the road i have \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","trodden with this company, i do not much doubt that i shall find a way \n","through rohan, and fangorn too, if need be.' \n","\n","'then i need say no more,' said celeborn. 'but do not despise the lore \n","that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives \n","keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.' \n","\n","now galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her \n","maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to celeborn. \n","\n","'now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,' she said. 'drink, lord \n","of the galadhrim! and let not your heart be sad though night must follow \n","noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.' \n","\n","then she brought the cup to each of the company, and bade them drink \n","and farewell. but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the \n","grass, and chairs were set for her and for celeborn. her maidens stood \n","silent about her, and a while she looked upon her guests. at last she spoke \n","again. \n","\n","'we have drunk the cup of parting,' she said, 'and the shadows fall \n","between us. but before you go, i have brought in my ship gifts which the \n","lord and lady of the galadhrim now offer you in memory of lothlurien.' \n","\n","then \n","\n","she called to each in turn. \n","\n","'here is the gift of celeborn and galadriel to the leader of your \n","company,' she said to aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made \n","to fit his sword. it was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves \n","wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven runes formed of many \n","gems the name andril and the lineage of the sword. \n","\n","'the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or \n","broken even in defeat,' she said. 'but is there aught else that you desire \n","of me at our parting? for darkness will flow between us, and it may be that \n","we shall not meet again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no \n","returning.' \n","\n","and aragorn answered: 'lady, you know all my desire, and long held in \n","keeping the only treasure that i seek. yet it is not yours to give me, even \n","if you would; and only through darkness shall i come to it.' \n","\n","'yet maybe this will lighten your heart,' said galadriel; 'for it was \n","left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.' then \n","she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a silver \n","brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings; \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the \n","leaves of spring. 'this stone i gave to celebrnan my daughter, and she to \n","hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. in this hour take the name \n","that was foretold for you, elessar, the elfstone of the house of elendil! ' \n","\n","then aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and \n","those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and \n","kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen \n","from his shoulders. 'for the gifts that you have given me i thank you,' he \n","said, 'o lady of lurien of whom were sprung celebrnan and arwen \n","evenstar. \n","\n","what praise could i say more? ' \n","\n","the lady bowed her head, and she turned then to boromir, and to him she \n","gave a belt of gold; and to merry and pippin she gave small silver belts, \n","each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. to legolas she gave a bow \n","such as the galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of mirkwood, \n","and strung with a string of elf-hair. with it went a quiver of arrows. \n","\n","'for you little gardener and lover of trees,' she said to sam, 'i have \n","only a small gift.' she put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood, \n","unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid. 'here is set g for \n","galadriel,' she said; 'but also it may stand for garden in your tongue. in \n","this box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as galadriel has \n","still to bestow is upon it. it will not keep you on your road, nor defend \n","you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last, \n","then perhaps it may reward you. though you should find all barren and laid \n","waste, there will be few gardens in middle-earth that will bloom like your \n","garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. then you may remember galadriel, \n","and catch a glimpse far off of lurien, that you have seen only in our \n","winter. for our spring and our summer are gone by, and they will never be \n","seen on earth again save in memory.' \n","\n","sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he \n","clutched the box and bowed as well as he could. \n","\n","'and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves? ' said galadriel turning \n","to gimli. \n","\n","'none, lady,' answered gimli. 'it is enough for me to have seen the \n","lady of the galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.' \n","\n","'hear all ye elves! ' she cried to those about her. 'let none say again \n","that dwarves are grasping and ungracious! yet surely, gimli son of gluin, \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","you desire something that i could give? name it, i bid you! you shall not be \n","the only guest without a gift.' \n","\n","'there is nothing, lady galadriel,' said gimli, bowing low and \n","stammering. 'nothing, unless it might be-unless it is permitted to ask. nay, \n","to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth \n","as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. i do not ask for such a gift. but \n","you commanded me to name my desire.' \n","\n","the elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and celeborn gazed at \n","the dwarf in wonder, but the lady smiled. 'it is said that the skill of the \n","dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues ' she said; 'yet that \n","is not true of gimli. for none have ever made to me a request so bold and \n","yet so courteous. and how shall i refuse, since i commanded him to speak? \n","but tell me, what would you do with such a gift? ' \n","\n","'treasure it, lady,' he answered, 'in memory of your words to me at our \n","first meeting. and if ever i return to the smithies of my home, it shall be \n","set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of \n","good will between the mountain and the wood until the end of days.' \n","\n","then the lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three \n","golden hairs, and laid them in gimli's hand. 'these words shall go with the \n","gift,' she said. 'i do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the \n","one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. but if hope should not \n","fail, then i say to you, gimli son of gluin, that your hands shall flow with \n","gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion. \n","\n","'and you, ring-bearer,' she said, turning to frodo. 'i come to you last \n","who are not last in my thoughts. for you i have prepared this.' she held up \n","a small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light \n","sprang from her hand. 'in this phial,' she said, 'is caught the light of \n","edrendil's star, set amid the waters of my fountain. it will shine still \n","brighter when night is about you. may it be a light to you in dark places, \n","when all other lights go out. remember galadriel and her mirror! ' \n","\n","frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw \n","her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer \n","terrible. he bowed, but found no words to say. \n","\n","now the lady arose, and celeborn led them back to the hythe. a yellow \n","noon lay on the green land of the tongue, and the water glittered with \n","silver. all at last was made ready. the company took their places in the \n","boats as before. crying farewell, the elves of lurien with long grey poles \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","thrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters bore them \n","slowly away. the travellers sat still without moving or speaking. on the \n","green bank near to the very point of the tongue the lady galadriel stood \n","alone and silent. as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her \n","slowly floating away from them. for so it seemed to them: lurien was \n","slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing \n","on to forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey \n","and leafless world. \n","\n","even as they gazed, the silverlode passed out into the currents of the \n","great river, and their boats turned and began to speed southwards. soon the \n","white form of the lady was small and distant. she shone like a window of \n","glass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a \n","mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. then it seemed to frodo \n","that she lifted her arms in a final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on \n","the following wind came the sound of her voice singing. but now she sang in \n","the ancient tongue of the elves beyond the sea, and he did not understand \n","the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him. \n","\n","yet as is the way of elvish words, they remained graven in his memory, \n","and long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could: the language \n","was that of elven-song and spoke of things little known on middle-earth. \n","\n","ai! lauril lantar lassi srinen, \n","\n","yjni nutiml ve rbmar aldaron! \n","\n","yjni ve lintl yuldar avbnier \n","mi oromardi lisse-miruvureva \n","andnl pella, vardo tellumar \n","nu luini yassen tintilar i eleni \n","umaryo airetbri-lnrinen. \n","\n","sn man iyulma nin enquantuva? \n","\n","an sn tintalll varda oiolosslo \n","ve fanyar mbryat elentbri ortanl \n","ar ilyl tier undulbvl lumbull; \n","ar sindanuriello caita mornil \n","i falmalinnar imbl met, ar hnsil \n","untpa calaciryo mnri oiall. \n","\n","si vanwa nb, rumello vanwa, valimar! \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","nambril! nai hiruvalyl valimar. \n","\n","nai elyl hiruva. nambril! \n","\n","'ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as \n","the wings of trees ! the long years have passed like swift draughts of the \n","sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the west, beneath the blue vaults of varda \n","wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice, holy and queenly. who \n","now shall refill the cup for me? for now the kindler, varda, the queen of \n","the stars, from mount everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all \n","paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country darkness lies on \n","the foaming waves between us, and mist covers the jewels of calacirya for \n","ever. now lost, lost to those from the east is valimar! farewell! maybe thou \n","shalt find valimar. maybe even thou shalt find it. farewell! ' varda is the \n","name of that fady whom the elves in these lands of exile name elbereth. \n","\n","suddenly the river swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon either \n","side, and the light of furien was hidden. to that fair land frodo never came \n","again. \n","\n","the travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was \n","before them, and their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. \n","\n","gimli wept openly. \n","\n","'i have looked the last upon that which was fairest,' he said to \n","fegolas his companion. 'henceforward i will call nothing fair, unless it be \n","her gift.' he put his hand to his breast. \n","\n","'tell me, fegolas, why did i come on this quest? tittle did i know \n","where the chief peril lay! truly elrond spoke, saying that we could not \n","foresee what we might meet upon our road. torment in the dark was the danger \n","that i feared, and it did not hold me back. but i would not have come, had i \n","known the danger of light and joy. now i have taken my worst wound in this \n","parting, even if i were to go this night straight to the dark ford. alas for \n","gimli son of gluin! ' \n","\n","'nay! ' said fegolas. 'alas for us all! and for all that walk the world \n","in these after-days. for such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it \n","seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. but i count you blessed, \n","gimli son of gluin: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you \n","might have chosen otherwise. but you have not forsaken your companions, \n","and \n","\n","the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of fothlurien shall \n","remain ever clear and unstained in your heart, and shall neither fade nor \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","grow stale.' \n","\n","'maybe,' said gimli; 'and i thank you for your words. true words \n","doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. memory is not what the heart \n","desires. that is only a mirror, be it clear as kheled-zvram. or so says the \n","heart of gimli the dwarf. elves may see things otherwise. indeed i have \n","heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream. \n","not so for dwarves. \n","\n","'but let us talk no more of it. look to the boat! she is too low in the \n","water with all this baggage, and the great river is swift. i do not wish to \n","drown my grief in cold water.' he took up a paddle, and steered towards the \n","western bank, following aragorn's boat ahead, which had already moved out of \n","the middle stream. \n","\n","so the company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters, \n","borne ever southwards. bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could \n","not see any glimpse of the lands behind. the breeze died away and the river \n","flowed without a sound. no voice of bird broke the silence. the sun grew \n","misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white \n","pearl. then it faded into the west, and dusk came early, followed by a grey \n","and starless night. far into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding \n","their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods. great trees \n","passed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the \n","mist down into the water. it was dreary and cold. frodo sat and listened to \n","the faint lap and gurgle of the river fretting among the tree-roots and \n","driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy \n","sleep. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 9 . the great river \n","\n","\n","\n","frodo was roused by sam. he found that he was lying, well wrapped, \n","under tall grey -skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west \n","bank of the great river, anduin. he had slept the night away, and the grey \n","of morning was dim among the bare branches. gimli was busy with a small fire \n","near at hand. \n","\n","they started again before the day was broad. not that most of the \n","company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision, \n","which they must make at latest when they came to rauros and the tindrock \n","isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the river bear them on at its \n","own pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond, \n","whichever course they took in the end. aragorn let them drift with the \n","stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness to come. \n","but he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey \n","on far into the evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, \n","and he feared that the dark lord had not been idle while they lingered in \n","lurien. \n","\n","nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day, nor the next. the \n","dull grey hours passed without event. as the third day of their voyage wore \n","on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether. \n","\n","on the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching \n","up and away toward the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had \n","passed over them, leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste \n","without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness. they \n","had come to the brown lands that lay, vast and desolate, between southern \n","mirkwood and the hills of the emyn muil. what pestilence or war or evil deed \n","of the enemy had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tell. \n","\n","upon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was \n","flat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass. on this side of \n","the river they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all \n","view to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along their \n","fluttering borders. their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light \n","cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. here and there through openings frodo \n","could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far beyond them hills in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where marched the \n","southernmost ranks of the misty mountains. \n","\n","there was no sign of living moving things, save birds. of these there \n","were many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds, but they were \n","seldom seen. once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of \n","swan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky. \n","'swans! ' said sam. 'and mighty big ones too! ' \n","\n","'yes,' said aragorn, 'and they are black swans.' \n","\n","'how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks! ' said frodo. \n","\n","'i always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier, \n","until winter was left behind for ever.' \n","\n","'but we have not journeyed far south yet,' answered aragorn. 'it is \n","still winter, and we are far from the sea. here the world is cold until the \n","sudden spring, and we may yet have snow again. far away down in the bay of \n","belfalas, to which anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but \n","for the enemy. but here we are not above sixty leagues, i guess, south of \n","the southfarthing away in your shire, hundreds of long miles yonder. you are \n","looking now south-west across the north plains of the riddermark, rohan the \n","land of the horse-lords. ere long we shall come to the mouth of the limlight \n","that runs down from fangorn to join the great river. that is the north \n","boundary of rohan; and of old all that lay between limlight and the white \n","mountains belonged to the rohirrim. it is a rich and pleasant land, and its \n","grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the river or \n","ride often to its shores. anduin is wide, yet the ores can shoot their \n","arrows far across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have dared to \n","cross the water and raid the herds and studs of rohan.' \n","\n","sam looked from bank to bank uneasily. the trees had seemed hostile \n","before, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished \n","that the trees were still there. he felt that the company was too naked, \n","afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, and on a \n","river that was the frontier of war. \n","\n","in the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, \n","this feeling of insecurity grew on all the company. for a whole day they \n","took to their paddles and hastened forward. the banks slid by. soon the \n","river broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east, \n","and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was \n","needed. the brown lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","from the east. on the other side the meads had become rolling downs of \n","withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. frodo shivered, thinking of \n","the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of lothlurien. there \n","was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats. each member of the \n","company was busy with his own thoughts. \n","\n","the heart of legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in \n","some northern glade amid the beech- woods; gimli was fingering gold in his \n","mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the \n","lady's gift. merry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for \n","boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some \n","restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving \n","the boat close behind aragorn's. then pippin, who sat in the bow looking \n","back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at frodo. \n","sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as \n","dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more \n","uncomfortable than even he had imagined. fie was cramped and miserable, \n","having nothing to do but stare at the winter -lands crawling by and the grey \n","water on either side of him. even when the paddles were in use they did not \n","trust sam with one. \n","\n","as dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed \n","heads of frodo and aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and \n","longed \n","\n","for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. suddenly something caught his \n","sight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his \n","eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more. \n","\n","that night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank. sam \n","lay rolled in blankets beside frodo. v i had a funny dream an hour or two \n","before we stopped, mr. frodo,' he said. 'or maybe it wasn't a dream. funny \n","it was anyway.' \n","\n","'well, what was it? ' said frodo, knowing that sam would not settle \n","down until he had told his tale, whatever it was. 'i haven't seen or thought \n","of anything to make me smile since we left lothlurien.' \n","\n","'it wasn't funny that way, mr. frodo. it was queer. all wrong, if it \n","wasn't a dream. and you had best hear it. it was like this: i saw a log with \n","eyes! ' \n","\n","'the log's all right,' said frodo. 'there are many in the river. but \n","leave out the eyes ! ' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'that i won't,' said sam. ' 'twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to \n","speak. i saw what i took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind \n","gimli's boat; but i didn't give much heed to it. then it seemed as if the \n","log was slowly catching us up. and that was peculiar, as you might say, \n","seeing as we were all floating on the stream together. just then i saw the \n","eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny -like, on a hump at the near end of the \n","log. what's more, it wasn't a log, for it had paddle-feet, like a swan's \n","almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water. \n","\n","'that's when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a \n","shout, if it was still there when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head. \n","\n","for the whatever -it-was was coming along fast now and getting close behind \n","gimli. but whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or whether \n","i came to my senses, i don't know. when i looked again, it wasn't there. yet \n","i think i caught a glimpse with the tail of-my eye, as the saying is, of \n","something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank. i couldn't see no more \n","eyes though. \n","\n","'i said to myself: \"dreaming again, sam gamgee,\" i said: and i said no \n","more just then. but i've been thinking since, and now i'm not so sure. what \n","do you make of it, mr. frodo? ' \n","\n","'i should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your \n","eyes sam, said frodo, if this was the first time that those eyes had been \n","seen. but it isn't. i saw them away back north before we reached lurien. and \n","i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night. haldir \n","saw it too. and do you remember the report of the elves that went after the \n","ore-band? ' \n","\n","'ah,' said sam. 'i do; and i remember more too. i don't like my \n","thoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and mr. bilbo's stories and \n","all, i fancy i could put a name on the creature, at a guess. a nasty name. \n","gollum, maybe? ' \n","\n","'yes, that is what i have feared for some time,' said frodo. 'ever \n","since the night on the flet. i suppose he was lurking in moria, and picked \n","up our trail then; but i hoped that our stay in lurien would throw him off \n","the scent again. the miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods \n","by the silverlode, watching us start off! ' \n","\n","'that's about it,' said sam. 'and we'd better be a bit more watchful \n","ourselves, or we'll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these \n","nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. and that's what i was leading \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","up to. no need to trouble strider or the others tonight. i'll keep watch. i \n","can sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.' \n","\n","v i might,' said frodo, 'and i might say \"luggage with eyes\". you shall \n","watch; but only if you promise to wake me halfway towards morning, if \n","nothing happens before then.' \n","\n","in the dead hours frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find sam \n","shaking him. 'it's a shame to wake you,' whispered sam, 'but that's what you \n","said. there's nothing to tell, or not much. i thought i heard some soft \n","plashing and a sniffing noise, a while back; but you hear a lot of such \n","queer sounds by a river at night.' \n","\n","he lay down, and frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off \n","his sleep. minutes or hours passed slowly, and nothing happened. frodo was \n","just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly \n","visible, floated close to one of the moored boats. a long whitish hand could \n","be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes \n","shone coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at \n","frodo on the eyot. they were not more than a yard or two away, and frodo \n","heard the soft hiss of intaken breath. he stood up, drawing sting from its \n","sheath, and faced the eyes. immediately their light was shut off. there was \n","another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream into \n","the night. aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up' \n","\n","'what is it? ' he whispered, springing up and coming to frodo. 'i felt \n","something in my sleep. why have you drawn your sword? ' \n","\n","'gollum,' answered frodo. 'or at least, so i guess.' \n","\n","'ah! ' said aragorn. 'so you know about our little footpad, do you? he \n","padded after us all through moria and right down to nimrodel. since we took \n","to boats, he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet. i \n","have tried to catch him once or twice at night; but he is slier than a fox, \n","and as slippery as a fish. i hoped the river-voyage would beat him, but he \n","is too clever a waterman. \n","\n","'we shall have to try going faster tomorrow. you lie down now, and i \n","will keep watch for what is left of the night. i wish i could lay my hands \n","on the wretch. we might make him useful. but if i cannot, we shall have to \n","try and lose him. he is very dangerous. quite apart from murder by night on \n","his own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track.' \n","\n","the night passed without gollum showing so much as a shadow again. \n","after that the company kept a sharp look-out, but they saw no more of gollum \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","while the voyage lasted. if he was still following, he was very wary and \n","cunning. at aragorn's bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the \n","banks went swiftly by. but they saw little of the country, for they \n","journeyed mostly by night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden \n","as the land allowed. in this way the time passed without event until the \n","seventh day. \n","\n","the weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the east, but \n","as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint \n","light, yellow and pale green, opened under the grey shores of cloud. there \n","the white rind of the new moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes. \n","sam looked at it and puckered his brows. \n","\n","the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly. the \n","banks began to rise and grow stony. soon they were passing through a hilly \n","rocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes \n","of thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers. behind them stood low \n","crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and \n","beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. \n","they were drawing near to the grey hill -country of the emyn muil, the \n","southern march of wilderland. \n","\n","there were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and all \n","day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling, black against the \n","pale sky. as they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched the flights \n","doubtfully, wondering if gollum had been doing some mischief and the news \n","of \n","\n","their voyage was now moving in the wilderness. later as the sun was setting, \n","and the company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a \n","dark spot against the fading light: a great bird high and far off, now \n","wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards. \n","\n","'what is that, legolas? ' he asked, pointing to the northern sky. 'is \n","it, as i think, an eagle? ' \n","\n","'yes.' said legolas. 'it is an eagle, a hunting eagle. i wonder what \n","that forebodes. it is far from the mountains.' \n","\n","'we will not start until it is fully dark,' said aragorn. \n","\n","the eighth night of their journey came. it was silent and windless; the \n","grey east wind had passed away. the thin crescent of the moon had fallen \n","early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away \n","in the south there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly, in \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the west stars glinted bright. \n","\n","'come! ' said aragorn. 'we will venture one more journey by night. we \n","are coming to reaches of the river that i do not know well: for i have never \n","journeyed by water in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of \n","sarn gebir. but if i am right in my reckoning, those are still many miles \n","ahead. still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and \n","stony eyots in the stream. we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle \n","swiftly.' \n","\n","to sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman. he lay \n","forward peering into the gloom. the night grew dark, but the stars above \n","were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer on the face of the river. it \n","was close on midnight, and they had been drifting for some while, hardly \n","using the paddles, when suddenly sam cried out. only a few yards ahead dark \n","shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water. there \n","was a swift current which swung left, towards the eastern shore where the \n","channel was clear. as they were swept aside the travellers could see, now \n","very close, the pale foam of the river lashing against sharp rocks that were \n","thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth. the boats were all \n","huddled together. \n","\n","'hoy there, aragorn! ' shouted boromir, as his boat bumped into the \n","leader. 'this is madness! we cannot dare the rapids by night! but no boat \n","can live in sarn gebir, be it night or day.' \n","\n","'back, back! ' cried aragorn. turn! turn if you can! ' he drove his \n","paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring it round. \n","\n","'i am out of my reckoning,' he said to frodo. 'i did not know that we \n","had come so far: anduin flows faster than i thought. sarn gebir must be \n","close at hand already.' \n","\n","with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them \n","about; but at first they could make only small headway against the current, \n","and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank. \n","\n","now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night. \n","\n","'all together, paddle! ' shouted boromir. 'paddle! or we shall be \n","driven on the shoals.' even as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him \n","grate upon stone. \n","\n","at that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled \n","over them, and some fell among them. one smote frodo between the \n","shoulders \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell \n","back, foiled by his hidden coat of mail. another passed through aragorn's \n","hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat, close by \n","merry's hand. sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro \n","upon the long shingle -banks that lay under the eastern shore. they seemed \n","very near. \n","\n","' yrch !' said legolas, falling into his own tongue. \n","\n","'ores! ' cried gimli. \n","\n","'gollum's doing, i'll be bound.' said sam to frodo. 'and a nice place \n","to choose, too. the river seems set on taking us right into their arms! ' \n","\n","they all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even sam took a hand. \n","every moment they expected to feel the bite of black -feathered arrows. many \n","whined overhead or struck the water nearby; but there were no more hits. it \n","was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of ores, and in the \n","star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless it \n","was that the grey cloaks of lurien and the grey timber of the elf- wrought \n","boats defeated the malice of the archers of mordor. \n","\n","stroke by stroke they laboured on. in the darkness it was hard to be \n","sure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water \n","grew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night. at \n","last, as far as they could judge, they had reached the middle of the stream \n","again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks. \n","then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the \n","western shore. under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they \n","halted and drew breath. \n","\n","legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought \n","from lurien. then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank. \n","stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over the \n","river into the darkness. across the water there were shrill cries, but \n","nothing could be seen. \n","\n","frodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into \n","the night, seeking a mark to shoot at. his head was dark, crowned with sharp \n","white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind. but now \n","rising and sailing up from the south the great clouds advanced, sending out \n","dark outriders into the starry fields. a sudden dread fell on the company. \n","\n","' elbereth gilthoniel!' sighed legolas as he looked up. even as he did \n","so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","swiftly, came out of the blackness in the south, and sped towards the \n","company, blotting out all light as it approached. soon it appeared as a \n","great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. fierce voices \n","rose up to greet it from across the water. frodo felt a sudden chill running \n","through him and clutching at his heart; there was a deadly cold, like the \n","memory of an old wound, in his shoulder. he crouched down, as if to hide. \n","\n","suddenly the great bow of lurien sang. shrill went the arrow from the \n","elven-string. frodo looked up. almost above him the winged shape swerved. \n","there was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down \n","into the gloom of the eastern shore. the sky was clean again. there was a \n","tumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness, and \n","then silence. neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night. \n","\n","after a while aragorn led the boats back upstream. they felt their way \n","along the water's edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow \n","bay. a few low trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a \n","steep rocky bank. here the company decided to stay and await the dawn: it \n","was useless to attempt to move further by night. they made no camp and lit \n","no fire, but lay huddled in the boats, moored close together. \n","\n","'praised be the bow of galadriel, and the hand and eye of legolas ! ' \n","said gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas. 'that was a mighty shot in the \n","dark, my friend!' \n","\n","'but who can say what it hit?' said legolas. \n","\n","'i cannot,' said gimli. 'but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer. \n","\n","i liked it not at all. too much it reminded me of the shadow in moria - the \n","shadow of the balrog,' he ended in a whisper. \n","\n","'it was not a balrog,' said frodo, still shivering with the chill that \n","had come upon him. 'it was something colder. i think it was - ' then he \n","paused and fell silent. \n","\n","'what do you think? ' asked boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as \n","if he was trying to catch a glimpse of frodo's face. \n","\n","'i think - no, i will not say,' answered frodo. 'whatever it was, its \n","fall has dismayed our enemies.' \n","\n","'so it seems,' said aragorn. 'yet where they are, and how many, and \n","what they will do next, we do not know. this night we must all be sleepless! \n","dark hides us now. but what the day will show who can tell? have your \n","weapons close to hand! ' \n","\n","sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","fingers, and looking up at the sky. \"it's very strange,' he murmured. 'the \n","moon's the same in the shire and in wilderland, or it ought to be. but \n","either it's out of its running, or i'm all wrong in my reckoning. you'll \n","remember, mr. frodo, the moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that \n","tree: a week from the full, i reckon. and we'd been a week on the way last \n","night, when up pops a new moon as thin as a nail-paring, as if we had never \n","stayed no time in the elvish country. \n","\n","'well, i can remember three nights there for certain, and i seem to \n","remember several more, but i would take my oath it was never a whole month. \n","anyone would think that time did not count in there! ' \n","\n","'and perhaps that was the way of it,' said frodo. 'in that land, maybe, \n","we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by. it was not, i think, \n","until silverlode bore us back to anduin that we returned to the time that \n","flows through mortal lands to the great sea. and i don't remember any moon, \n","either new or old, in caras galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.' \n","\n","legolas stirred in his boat. 'nay, time does not tarry ever,' he said; \n","\n","'but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. for the elves \n","the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. swift, because \n","they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to \n","them. slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves. \n","the passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream. \n","\n","yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last.' \n","\n","'but the wearing is slow in lurien,' said frodo. 'the power of the lady \n","is on it. rich are the hours, though short they seem, in caras galadhon, \n","where galadriel wields the elven-ring.' \n","\n","'that should not have been said outside lurien, not even to me,' said \n","aragorn. 'speak no more of it! but so it is, sam: in that land you lost your \n","count. there time flowed swiftly by us, as for the elves. the old moon \n","passed, and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside, while we \n","tarried there. and yestereve a new moon came again. winter is nearly gone. \n","time flows on to a spring of little hope.' \n","\n","the night passed silently. no voice or call was heard again across the \n","water. the travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the \n","weather. the air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that \n","had floated up from the south and the distant seas. the rushing of the river \n","over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer. the twigs of \n","the trees above them began to drip. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","when the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and \n","sad. slowly the dawn grew to a pale light, diffused and shadowless. there \n","was mist on the river, and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could \n","not be seen. \n","\n","'i can't abide fog,' said sam; 'but this seems to be a lucky one. now \n","perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us.' \n","\n","'perhaps so,' said aragorn. 'but it will be hard to find the path \n","unless the fog lifts a little later on. and we must find the path, if we are \n","to pass sarn gebir and come to the emyn muil.' \n","\n","'i do not see why we should pass the rapids or follow the river any \n","further,' said boromir. 'if the emyn muil lie before us, then we can abandon \n","these cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward, until we come to the \n","entwash and cross into my own land.' \n","\n","'we can, if we are making for minas tirith,' said aragorn, 'but that is \n","not yet agreed. and such a course may be more perilous than it sounds. the \n","vale of entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those \n","on foot and laden. i would not abandon our boats until we must. the river is \n","at least a path that cannot be missed.' \n","\n","'but the enemy holds the eastern bank,' objected boromir. 'and even if \n","you pass the gates of argonath and come unmolested to the tindrock, what \n","will you do then? leap down the falls and land in the marshes? ' \n","\n","'no! ' answered aragorn. 'say rather that we will bear our boats by the \n","ancient way to rauros-foot, and there take to the water again. do you not \n","know, boromir, or do you choose to forget the north stair, and the high seat \n","upon amon hen, that were made in the days of the great kings? i at least \n","have a mind to stand in that high place again, before i decide my further \n","course. there, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.' \n","\n","boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain \n","that frodo would follow aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in. 'it is not \n","the way of the men of minas tirith to desert their friends at need,' he \n","said, 'and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the tindrock. \n","\n","to the tall isle i will go, but no further. there i shall turn to my home, \n","alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship.' \n","\n","the day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. it was \n","decided that aragorn and legolas should at once go forward along the shore, \n","while the others remained by the boats. aragorn hoped to find some way by \n","which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","water beyond the rapids. \n","\n","'boats of the elves would not sink, maybe,' he said, 'but that does not \n","say that we should come through sarn gebir alive. none have ever done so \n","yet. no road was made by the men of gondor in this region, for even in their \n","great days their realm did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil; but \n","there is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore, if i can find it. it \n","cannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey out of wilderland \n","down to osgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the ores of \n","mordor began to multiply.' \n","\n","'seldom in my life has any boat come out of the north, and the ores \n","prowl on the east-shore,' said boromir. 'if you go forward, peril will grow \n","with every mile, even if you find a path.' \n","\n","'peril lies ahead on every southward road,' answered aragorn. 'wait for \n","us one day. if we do not return in that time, you will know that evil has \n","indeed befallen us. then you must take a new leader and follow him as best \n","you can.' \n","\n","it was with a heavy heart that frodo saw aragorn and legolas climb the \n","steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless. only \n","two or three hours had passed, and it was barely mid-day, when the shadowy \n","shapes of the explorers appeared again. \n","\n","'all is well,' said aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. 'there is a \n","track, and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable. the \n","distance is not great: the head of the rapids is but half a mile below us, \n","and they are little more than a mile long. not far beyond them the stream \n","becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. our hardest task \n","will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage- way. we have found \n","it, but it lies well back from the water-side here, and runs under the lee \n","of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore. we did not find where the \n","northward landing lies. if it still remains, we must have passed it \n","yesterday night. we might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog. i \n","fear we must leave the river now, and make for the portage-way as best we \n","can from here.' \n","\n","'that would not be easy, even if we were all men,' said boromir. \n","\n","'yet such as we are we will try it,' said aragorn. \n","\n","'aye, we will,' said gimli. 'the legs of men will lag on a rough road, \n","while a dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight, master boromir! ' \n","\n","the task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. the goods were \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a \n","level space. then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. they \n","were far less heavy than any had expected. of what tree growing in the \n","elvish country they were made not even legolas knew; but the wood was \n","tough \n","\n","and yet strangely light. merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with \n","ease along the flat. nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to \n","lift and haul them over the ground that the company now had to cross. it \n","sloped up away from the river, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders, \n","with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were thickets \n","of brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters \n","trickling from the terraces further inland. \n","\n","one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats, while the others \n","toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage. at last all was removed \n","and laid on the portage-way. then with little further hindrance, save from \n","sprawling briars and many fallen stones, they moved forward all together. \n","fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist \n","shrouded the river: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp \n","shelves and stony teeth of sarn gebir, but they could not see it. twice they \n","made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing. \n","\n","there the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down \n","to the shallow edge of a little pool. it seemed to have been scooped in the \n","river-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling down from sarn gebir \n","against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream. beyond \n","it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff, and there was no further passage \n","for those on foot. \n","\n","already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing \n","in. they sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the \n","rapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were \n","as gloomy as the dying day. \n","\n","'well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,' said boromir. \n","\n","'we need sleep, and even if aragorn had a mind to pass the gates of argonath \n","by night, we are all too tired-except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.' \n","\n","gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat. \n","\n","'let us rest as much as we can now,' said aragorn. 'tomorrow we must \n","journey by day again. unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we \n","shall have a good chance of slipping through, unseen by any eyes on the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","eastern shore. but tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off \n","and one on guard.' \n","\n","nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour \n","before dawn. as soon as it was fully light they started. already the fog was \n","thinning. they kept as close as they could to the western side, and they \n","could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls \n","with their feet in the hurrying river. in the mid-morning the clouds drew \n","down lower, and it began to rain heavily. they drew the skin -covers over \n","their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on: little could \n","be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains. \n","\n","the rain, however, did not last long. slowly the sky above grew \n","lighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled fringes \n","trailed away northward up the river. the fogs and mists were gone. before \n","the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which clung, \n","upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. the channel grew \n","narrower and the river swifter. now they were speeding along with little \n","hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. over them was a \n","lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed river, and before \n","them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of emyn muil, in which no \n","opening could be seen. \n","\n","frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching: \n","like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed. tall and sheer and \n","ominous they stood upon either side of the stream. a narrow gap appeared \n","between them, and the river swept the boats towards it. \n","\n","'behold the argonath, the pillars of the kings! ' cried aragorn. 'we \n","shall pass them soon. keep the boats in line, and as far apart as you can! \n","\n","hold the middle of the stream! ' \n","\n","as frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to \n","meet him. giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures silent but \n","threatening. then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned: the \n","craft and power of old had wrought upon them, and still they preserved \n","through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which \n","they had been hewn. upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood \n","two great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they \n","frowned upon the north. the left hand of each was raised palm outwards in \n","gesture of warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head \n","there was a crumbling helm and crown. great power and majesty they still \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","wore, the silent wardens of a long -vanished kingdom. awe and fear fell upon \n","frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as \n","the boat drew near. even boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by. \n","frail and fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring shadow of the \n","sentinels of nmenor. so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates. \n","\n","sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side. far \n","off was the dim sky. the black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed \n","over them. frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering and \n","groaning: 'what a place! what a horrible place! just let me get out of this \n","boat, and i'll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river! ' \n","\n","'fear not!' said a strange voice behind him. frodo turned and saw \n","strider, and yet not strider; for the weatherworn ranger was no longer \n","there. in the stern sat aragorn son of arathorn, proud and erect, guiding \n","the boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, and his dark hair was \n","blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes: a king returning from exile to \n","his own land. \n","\n","'fear not! ' he said. 'long have i desired to look upon the likenesses \n","of isildur and anbrion, my sires of old. under their shadow elessar, the \n","elfstone son of arathorn of the house of valandil isildur's son heir of \n","elendil, has nought to dread! ' \n","\n","then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: 'would that \n","gandalf were here! how my heart yearns for minas anor and the walls of my \n","own city! but whither now shall i go? ' \n","\n","the chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind and \n","rushing water and echoing stone. it bent somewhat towards the west so that \n","at first all was dark ahead; but soon frodo saw a tall gap of light before \n","him, ever growing. swiftly it drew near, and suddenly the boats shot \n","through, out into a wide clear light. \n","\n","the sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. \n","\n","the pent waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale nen hithoel, fenced \n","by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were \n","bare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight. at the far southern end rose three \n","peaks. the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered \n","from \n","\n","them, an island in the waters, about which the flowing river flung pale \n","shimmering arms. distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound \n","like the roll of thunder heard far away. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'behold tol brandir! ' said aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak. \n","\n","'upon the left stands amon lhaw, and upon the right is amon hen the hills of \n","hearing and of sight. in the days of the great kings there were high seats \n","upon them, and watch was kept there. but it is said that no foot of man or \n","beast has ever been set upon tol brandir. ere the shade of night falls we \n","shall come to them. i hear the endless voice of rauros calling.' \n","\n","the company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current that \n","flowed through the middle of the lake. they ate some food, and then they \n","took to their paddles and hastened on their way. the sides of the westward \n","hills fell into shadow, and the sun grew round and red. here and there a \n","misty star peered out. the three peaks loomed before them, darkling in the \n","twilight. rauros was roaring with a great voice. already night was laid on \n","the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the \n","hills. \n","\n","the tenth day of their journey was over. wilderland was behind them. \n","they could go no further without choice between the east-way and the west. \n","the last stage of the quest was before them. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","chapter 10. the breaking of the fellowship \n","\n","\n","\n","aragorn led them to the right arm of the river. here upon its western \n","side under the shadow of tol brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from \n","the feet of amon hen. behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill \n","clad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of \n","the lake. a little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass. \n","\n","'here we will rest tonight,' said aragorn. 'this is the lawn of parth \n","galen: a fair place in the summer days of old. let us hope that no evil has \n","yet come here.' \n","\n","they drew up their boats on the green banks, and beside them they made \n","their camp. they set a watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies. \n","\n","if gollum had contrived to follow them, he remained unseen and unheard. \n","nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in his \n","sleep and waking. in the small hours he got up and came to frodo, whose turn \n","it was to watch. \n","\n","'why are you waking? ' asked frodo. 'it is not your watch.' \n","\n","'i do not know,' answered aragorn; 'but a shadow and a threat has been \n","growing in my sleep. it would be well to draw your sword.' \n","\n","'why? ' said frodo. 'are enemies at hand? ' \n","\n","'let us see what sting may show,' answered aragorn. \n","\n","frodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. to his dismay the edges \n","gleamed dimly in the night. 'ores! ' he said. 'not very near, and yet too \n","near, it seems.' \n","\n","'i feared as much,' said aragorn. 'but maybe they are not on this side \n","of the river. the light of sting is faint, and it may point to no more than \n","spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw. i have never heard \n","before of ores upon amon hen. yet who knows what may happen in these \n","evil \n","\n","days, now that minas tirith no longer holds secure the passages of anduin. \n","we must go warily tomorrow.' \n","\n","the day came like fire and smoke. low in the east there were black bars \n","of cloud like the fumes of a great burning. the rising sun lit them from \n","beneath with flames of murky red; but soon it climbed above them into a \n","clear sky. the summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold. frodo looked out \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","eastward and gazed at the tall island. its sides sprang sheer out of the \n","running water. high up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which \n","trees climbed, mounting one head above another; and above them again were \n","grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of stone. many \n","birds were circling about it, but no sign of other living things could be \n","seen. \n","\n","when they had eaten, aragorn called the company together. 'the day has \n","come at last,' he said: 'the day of choice which we have long delayed. what \n","shall now become of our company that has travelled so far in fellowship? \n","shall we turn west with boromir and go to the wars of gondor; or turn east \n","to the fear and shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and \n","that as each may choose? whatever we do must be done soon. we cannot \n","long \n","\n","halt here. the enemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but i fear that the \n","ores may already be on this side of the water.' \n","\n","there was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved. \n","\n","'well, frodo,' said aragorn at last. 'i fear that the burden is laid \n","upon you. you are the bearer appointed by the council. your own way you \n","alone can choose. in this matter i cannot advise you. i am not gandalf, and \n","though i have tried to bear his part, i do not know what design or hope he \n","had for this hour, if indeed he had any. most likely it seems that if he \n","were here now the choice would still wait on you. such is your fate.' \n","\n","frodo did not answer at once. then he spoke slowly. 'i know that haste \n","is needed, yet i cannot choose. the burden is heavy. give me an hour longer, \n","and i will speak. let me be alone! ' \n","\n","aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. 'very well, frodo son of \n","drogo,' he said. 'you shall have an hour, and you shall be alone. we will \n","stay here for a while. but do not stray far or out of call.' \n","\n","frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. sam, who had been watching \n","his master with great concern, shook his head and muttered: 'plain as a \n","pikestaff it is, but it's no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke just now.' \n","\n","presently frodo got up and walked away; and sam saw that while the \n","others restrained themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes of boromir \n","followed frodo intently, until he passed out of sight in the trees at the \n","foot of amon hen. \n","\n","wandering aimlessly at first in the wood, frodo found that his feet \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill. he came to a path, the \n","dwindling ruins of a road of long ago. in steep places stairs of stone had \n","been hewn, but now they were cracked and worn, and split by the roots of \n","trees. for some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he \n","came to a grassy place. rowan-trees grew about it, and in the midst was a \n","wide flat stone. the little upland lawn was open upon the east and was \n","filled now with the early sunlight. frodo halted and looked out over the \n","river, far below him, to tol brandir and the birds wheeling in the great \n","gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle. the voice of rauros was a \n","mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom. \n","\n","he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands, staring \n","eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. all that had happened since bilbo \n","left the shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered \n","everything that he could remember of gandalf s words. time went on, and \n","still he was no nearer to a choice. \n","\n","suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that \n","something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him. he sprang up \n","and turned; but all that he saw to his surprise was boromir, and his face \n","was smiling and kind. \n","\n","'i was afraid for you, frodo,' he said, coming forward. 'if aragorn is \n","right and ores are near, then none of us should wander alone, and you least \n","of all: so much depends on you. and my heart too is heavy. may i stay now \n","and talk for a while, since i have found you? it would comfort me. where \n","there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. but two together \n","may perhaps find wisdom.' \n","\n","'you are kind,' answered frodo. 'but i do not think that any speech \n","will help me. for i know what i should do, but i am afraid of doing it, \n","boromir: afraid.' \n","\n","boromir stood silent. rauros roared endlessly on. the wind murmured in \n","the branches of the trees. frodo shivered. \n","\n","suddenly boromir came and sat beside him. 'are you sure that you do not \n","suffer needlessly? ' he said. 'i wish to help you. you need counsel in your \n","hard choice. will you not take mine? ' \n","\n","'i think i know already what counsel you would give, boromir,' said \n","frodo. 'and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.' \n","\n","'warning? warning against what? ' said boromir sharply. \n","\n","'against delay. against the way that seems easier. against refusal of \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the burden that is laid on me. against -well, if it must be said, against \n","trust in the strength and truth of men.' \n","\n","'yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little \n","country, though you knew it not.' \n","\n","'i do not doubt the valour of your people. but the world is changing. \n","\n","the walls of minas tirith may be strong, but they are not strong enough. if \n","they fail, what then? ' \n","\n","'we shall fall in battle valiantly. yet there is still hope that they \n","will not fail.' \n","\n","'no hope while the ring lasts,' said frodo. \n","\n","'ah! the ring! ' said boromir, his eyes lighting. 'the ring! is it not \n","a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a \n","thing? so small a thing! and i have seen it only for an instant in the house \n","of elrond. could i not have a sight of it again? ' \n","\n","frodo looked up. his heart went suddenly cold. he caught the strange \n","gleam in boromir's eyes, yet his face was still kind and friendly. 'it is \n","best that it should lie hidden,' he answered. \n","\n","'as you wish. i care not,' said boromir. 'yet may i not even speak of \n","it? for you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the enemy: \n","of its evil uses not of its good. the world is changing, you say. minas \n","tirith will fall, if the ring lasts. but why? certainly, if the ring were \n","with the enemy. but why, if it were with us? ' \n","\n","'were you not at the council? ' answered frodo. 'because we cannot use \n","it, and what is done with it turns to evil.' \n","\n","boromir got up and walked about impatiently. 'so you go on,' he cried. \n","'gandalf, elrond - all these folk have taught you to say so. for themselves \n","they may be right. these elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come \n","to grief perhaps. yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. \n","\n","but each to his own kind. true-hearted men, they will not be corrupted. we \n","of minas tirith have been staunch through long years of trial. we do not \n","desire the power of wizard-lords, only strength to defend ourselves, \n","strength in a just cause. and behold! in our need chance brings to light the \n","-ring of power. it is a gift, i say; a gift to the foes of mordor. it is mad \n","not to use it, to use the power of the enemy against him. the fearless, the \n","ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. what could not a warrior do in \n","this hour, a great leader? what could not aragorn do? or if he refuses, why \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","not boromir? the ring would give me power of command. how i would \n","drive the \n","\n","hosts of mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!' \n","\n","boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: almost he seemed \n","to have forgotten frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the \n","mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious \n","victories to be; and he cast down mordor, and became himself a mighty king, \n","benevolent and wise. suddenly he stopped and waved his arms. \n","\n","'and they tell us to throw it away!' he cried. 'i do not say destroy \n","it. that might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so. it does \n","not. the only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk \n","blindly into mordor and offer the enemy every chance of recapturing it for \n","himself. folly! \n","\n","'surely you see it, my friend?' he said, turning now suddenly to frodo \n","again. 'you say that you are afraid. if it is so, the boldest should pardon \n","you. but is it not really your good sense that revolts?' \n","\n","'no, i am afraid,' said frodo. 'simply afraid. but i am glad to have \n","heard you speak so fully. my mind is clearer now.' \n","\n","'then you will come to minas tirith? ' cried boromir. his eyes were \n","shining and his face eager. \n","\n","'you misunderstand me,' said frodo. \n","\n","'but you will come, at least for a while? ' boromir persisted. 'my city \n","is not far now; and it is little further from there to mordor than from \n","here. we have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the \n","enemy is doing before you make a move. come with me, frodo,' he said. \n","'you \n","\n","need rest before your venture, if go you must.' he laid his hand on the \n","hobbit's shoulder in friendly fashion; but frodo felt the hand trembling \n","with suppressed excitement. he stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the \n","tall man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength. \n","\n","'why are you so unfriendly? ' said boromir. 'i am a true man, neither \n","thief nor tracker. i need your ring: that you know now; but i give you my \n","word that i do not desire to keep it. will you not at least let me make \n","trial of my plan? lend me the ring! ' \n","\n","'no! no! ' cried frodo. 'the council laid it upon me to bear it.' \n","\n","'it is by our own folly that the enemy will defeat us,' cried boromir. \n","\n","'how it angers me! fool! obstinate fool! running wilfully to death and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","mining our cause. if any mortals have claim to the ring, it is the men of \n","nmenor, and not halflings. it is not yours save by unhappy chance. it might \n","have been mine. it should be mine. give it to me ! ' \n","\n","frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood \n","between them. 'come, come, my friend! ' said boromir in a softer voice. 'why \n","not get rid of it? why not be free of your doubt and fear? you can lay the \n","blame on me, if you will. you can say that i was too strong and took it by \n","force. for i am too strong for you, halfling,' he cried; and suddenly he \n","sprang over the stone and leaped at frodo. his fair and pleasant face was \n","hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes. \n","\n","frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. there was only \n","one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the ring upon its chain and \n","quickly slipped it on his finger, even as boromir sprang at him again. the \n","man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking \n","here and there among the rocks and trees. \n","\n","'miserable trickster!' he shouted. 'let me get my hands on you! now i \n","see your mind. you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all. you have \n","only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. curse you and all \n","halflings to death and darkness ! ' then, catching his foot on a stone, he \n","fell sprawling and lay upon his face. for a while he was as still as if his \n","own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept. \n","\n","he rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. \n","\n","'what have i said? ' he cried. 'what have i done? frodo, frodo! ' he called. \n","'come back! a madness took me, but it has passed. come back! ' \n","\n","there was no answer. frodo did not even hear his cries. he was already \n","far away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. terror and grief \n","shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of boromir, and his \n","burning eyes. \n","\n","soon he came out alone on the summit of amon hen, and halted, gasping \n","for breath. he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty \n","flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set \n","upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. \n","\n","up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that \n","had clambered upon the throne of mountain -kings. \n","\n","at first he could see little. he seemed to be in a world of mist in \n","which there were only shadows: the ring was upon him. then here and there \n","the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. there was no sound, only bright \n","living images. the world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. he was \n","sitting upon the seat of seeing, on amon hen, the hill of the eye of the men \n","of nmenor. eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, \n","and forests unexplored. northward he looked, and the great river lay like a \n","ribbon beneath him, and the misty mountains stood small and hard as broken \n","teeth. westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of rohan; and orthanc, \n","the pinnacle of isengard, like a black spike. southward he looked, and below \n","his very feet the great river curled like a toppling wave and plunged over \n","the falls of rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the \n","fume. and ethir anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the river, and myriads of \n","sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green \n","and silver sea, rippling in endless lines. \n","\n","but everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. the misty mountains \n","were crawling like anthills: ores were issuing out of a thousand holes. \n","\n","under the boughs of mirkwood there was deadly strife of elves and men and \n","fell beasts. the land of the beornings was aflame; a cloud was over moria; \n","smoke rose on the borders of lurien. \n","\n","horsemen were galloping on the grass of rohan; wolves poured from \n","isengard. from the havens of harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of \n","the east men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon \n","horses, \n","\n","chariots of chieftains and laden wains. all the power of the dark lord was \n","in motion. then turning south again he beheld minas tirith. far away it \n","seemed, and beautiful: white-walled, many -towered, proud and fair upon its \n","mountain- seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were \n","bright with many banners. hope leaped in his heart. but against minas tirith \n","was set another fortress, greater and more strong. thither, eastward, \n","unwilling his eye was drawn. it passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath, the \n","grinning gates of minas morgul. and the haunted mountains, and it looked \n","upon gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the land of mordor. darkness lay \n","there under the sun. fire glowed amid the smoke. mount doom was burning, \n","and \n","\n","a great reek rising. then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, \n","battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, \n","gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: barad-dyr, fortress of sauron. \n","\n","all hope left him. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","and suddenly he felt the eye. there was an eye in the dark tower that \n","did not sleep. he knew that it had become aware of his gaze. a fierce eager \n","will was there. it leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, \n","searching for him. very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where \n","he was. amon lhaw it touched. it glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself \n","from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood. \n","\n","he heard himself crying out: never, never! or was it: verily i come, i \n","come to you ? he could not tell. then as a flash from some other point of \n","power there came to his mind another thought: take it off! take it off! \n","\n","fool, take it off! take off the ring! \n","\n","the two powers strove in him. for a moment, perfectly balanced between \n","their piercing points, he writhed, tormented. suddenly he was aware of \n","himself again. frodo, neither the voice nor the eye: free to choose, and \n","with one remaining instant in which to do so. he took the ring off his \n","finger. he was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat. a black \n","shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him; it missed amon hen and \n","groped \n","\n","out west, and faded. then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in \n","every tree. \n","\n","frodo rose to his feet. a great weariness was on him, but his will was \n","firm and his heart lighter. he spoke aloud to himself. t will do now what i \n","must,' he said. this at least is plain: the evil of the ring is already at \n","work even in the company, and the ring must leave them before it does more \n","harm. i will go alone. some i cannot trust, and those i can trust are too \n","dear to me: poor old sam, and merry and pippin. strider, too: his heart \n","yearns for minas tirith, and he will be needed there, now boromir has fallen \n","into evil. i will go alone. at once.' \n","\n","he went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where boromir \n","had found him. then he halted, listening. he thought he could hear cries and \n","calls from the woods near the shore below. \n","\n","'they'll be hunting for me,' he said. t wonder how long i have been \n","away. hours, i should think.' he hesitated. 'what can i do? ' he muttered. \n","\n","'i must go now or i shall never go. i shan't get a chance again. i hate \n","leaving them, and like this without any explanation. but surely they will \n","understand. sam will. and what else can i do?' \n","\n","slowly he drew out the ring and put it on once more. he vanished and \n","passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","the others remained long by the river -side. for some time they had been \n","silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and \n","they were talking. every now and again they made efforts to speak of other \n","things, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned aragorn \n","concerning the realm of gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of \n","its great works that could still be seen in this strange border -land of the \n","emyn muil: the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and hen, and the great \n","stair beside the falls of rauros. but always their thoughts and words \n","strayed back to frodo and the ring. what would frodo choose to do? why \n","was \n","\n","he hesitating? \n","\n","'he is debating which course is the most desperate, i think,' said \n","aragorn. 'and well he may. it is now more hopeless than ever for the company \n","to go east, since we have been tracked by gollum, and must fear that the \n","secret of our journey is already betrayed. but minas tirith is no nearer to \n","the fire and the destruction of the burden. \n","\n","'we may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the lord \n","denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even elrond said was beyond \n","his power: either to keep the burden secret, or to hold off the full might \n","of the enemy when he comes to take it. which way would any of us choose in \n","frodo's place? i do not know. now indeed we miss gandalf most.' \n","\n","'grievous is our loss,' said legolas. 'yet we must needs make up our \n","minds without his aid. why cannot we decide, and so help frodo? let us call \n","him back and then vote! i should vote for minas tirith.' \n","\n","'and so should i,' said gimli. 'we, of course, were only sent to help \n","the bearer along the road, to go no further than we wished; and none of us \n","is under any oath or command to seek mount doom. hard was my parting \n","from \n","\n","lothlurien. yet i have come so far, and i say this: now we have reached the \n","last choice, it is clear to me that i cannot leave frodo. i would choose \n","minas tirith, but if he does not, then i follow him.' \n","\n","'and i too will go with him,' said legolas. 'it would be faithless now \n","to say farewell.' \n","\n","'it would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,' said aragorn. 'but \n","if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do i think that all \n","should. that venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, \n","or one alone. if you would let me choose, then i should appoint three \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","companions: sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and gimli; and myself. \n","boromir will return to his own city, where his father and his people need \n","him; and with him the others should go, or at least meriadoc and peregrin, \n","if legolas is not willing to leave us.' \n","\n","'that won't do at all! ' cried merry. 'we can't leave frodo! pippin and \n","i always intended to go wherever he went, and we still do. but we did not \n","realize what that would mean. it seemed different so far away, in the shire \n","or in ri vendell. it would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor. why \n","can't we stop him?' \n","\n","'we must stop him,' said pippin. 'and that is what he is worrying \n","about, i am sure. he knows we shan't agree to his going east. and he doesn't \n","like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. imagine it: going off to \n","mordor alone! ' pippin shuddered. 'but the dear silly old hobbit, he ought \n","to know that he hasn't got to ask. he ought to know that if we can't stop \n","him, we shan't leave him.' \n","\n","'begging your pardon,' said sam. 'i don't think you understand my \n","master at all. he isn't hesitating about which way to go. of course not! \n","what's the good of minas tirith anyway? to him, i mean, begging your \n","pardon, \n","\n","master boromir,' he added, and turned. it was then that they discovered that \n","boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle, \n","was no longer there. \n","\n","'now where's he got to? ' cried sam, looking worried. 'he's been a bit \n","queer lately, to my mind. but anyway he's not in this business. he's off to \n","his home, as he always said; and no blame to him. but mr. frodo, he knows \n","he's got to find the cracks of doom, if he can. but he's afraid. now it's \n","come to the point, he's just plain terrified. that's what his trouble is. of \n","course he's had a bit of schooling, so to speak-we all have-since we left \n","home, or he'd be so terrified he'd just fling the ring in the river and \n","bolt. but he's still too frightened to start. and he isn't worrying about us \n","either: whether we'll go along with him or no. he knows we mean to. that's \n","another thing that's bothering him. if he screws himself up to go, he'll \n","want to go alone. mark my words! we're going to have trouble when he \n","comes \n","\n","back. for he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's baggins.' \n","\n","'i believe you speak more wisely than any of us, sam,' said aragorn. \n","'and what shall we do, if you prove right? ' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'stop him! don't let him go! ' cried pippin. \n","\n","'i wonder? ' said aragorn. 'he is the bearer, and the fate of the \n","burden is on him. i do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or \n","the other. nor do i think that we should succeed, if we tried. there are \n","other powers at work far stronger.' \n","\n","'well, i wish frodo would \"screw himself up\" and come back, and let us \n","get it over,' said pippin. 'this waiting is horrible! surely the time is up? \n","\n","f \n","\n","'yes,' said aragorn. 'the hour is long passed. the morning is wearing \n","away. we must call for him.' \n","\n","at that moment boromir reappeared. he came out from the trees and \n","walked towards them without speaking. his face looked grim and sad. he \n","paused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with \n","his eyes on the ground. \n","\n","'where have you been, boromir? ' asked aragorn. 'have you seen frodo? ' \n","\n","boromir hesitated for a second. 'yes, and no,' he answered slowly. \n","\n","'yes: i found him some way up the hill, and i spoke to him. i urged him to \n","come to minas tirith and not to go east. i grew angry and he left me. he \n","vanished. i have never seen such a thing happen before, though i have heard \n","of it in tales. he must have put the ring on. i could not find him again. i \n","thought he would return to you.' \n","\n","'is that all that you have to say? ' said aragorn, looking hard and not \n","too kindly at boromir. \n","\n","'yes,' he answered. 'i will say no more yet.' \n","\n","'this is bad!' cried sam, jumping up. 'i don't know what this man has \n","been up to. why should mr. frodo put the thing on? he didn't ought to have; \n","and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!' \n","\n","'but he wouldn't keep it on' 1 said merry. 'not when he had escaped the \n","unwelcome visitor, like bilbo used to.' \n","\n","'but where did he go? where is he? ' cried pippin. 'he's been away ages \n","now.' \n","\n","'how long is it since you saw frodo last, boromir? ' asked aragorn. \n","\n","'half an hour, maybe,' he answered. 'or it might be an hour. i have \n","wandered for some time since. i do not know! i do not know! ' he put his \n","head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief. \n","\n","'an hour since he vanished! ' shouted sam. 'we must try and find him at \n","once. come on! ' \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","'wait a moment! ' cried aragorn. 'we must divide up into pairs, and \n","arrange-here, hold on! wait! ' \n","\n","it was no good. they took no notice of him. sam had dashed off first. \n","merry and pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into \n","the trees by the shore, shouting: frodo! frodo ! in their clear, high \n","hobbit- voices. legolas and gimli were running. a sudden panic or madness \n","seemed to have fallen on the company. \n","\n","'we shall all be scattered and lost,' groaned aragorn. 'boromir! i do \n","not know what part you have played in this mischief, but help now! go after \n","those two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot \n","find frodo. come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. i \n","shall return soon.' \n","\n","aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam. just as he \n","reached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him, toiling uphill, \n","panting and calling, frodo! \n","\n","'come with me, sam! ' he said. 'none of us should be alone. there is \n","mischief about. i feel it. i am going to the top, to the seat of amon hen, \n","to see what may be seen. and look! it is as my heart guessed, frodo went \n","this way. follow me, and keep your eyes open! ' he sped up the path. \n","\n","sam did his best, but he could not keep up with strider the ranger, and \n","soon fell behind. he had not gone far before aragorn was out of sight ahead. \n","sam stopped and puffed. suddenly he clapped his hand to his head. \n","\n","'whoa, sam gamgee! ' he said aloud. 'your legs are too short, so use \n","your head! let me see now! boromir isn't lying, that's not his way; but he \n","hasn't told us everything. something scared mr. frodo badly. he screwed \n","himself up to the point, sudden. he made up his mind at last to go. where \n","to? off east. not without sam? yes, without even his sam. that's hard, cruel \n","hard.' \n","\n","sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. 'steady, \n","gamgee! ' he said. 'think, if you can! he can't fly across rivers, and he \n","can't jump waterfalls. he's got no gear. so he's got to get back to the \n","boats. back to the boats! back to the boats, sam, like lightning! ' \n","\n","sam turned and bolted back down the path. he fell and cut his knees. up \n","he got and ran on. he came to the edge of the lawn of parth galen by the \n","shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the water. no one was there. \n","there seemed to be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them. he \n","stood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. a boat was sliding down the \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","bank all by itself. with a shout sam raced across the grass. the boat \n","slipped into the wat \n","\n","\n","\n","128d \n","\n","\n","\n","er. \n","\n","'coming, mr. frodo! coming! ' called sam, and flung himself from the \n","bank, clutching at the departing boat. he missed it by a yard. with a cry \n","and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water. gurgling he went \n","under, and the river closed over his curly head. \n","\n","an exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. a paddle swirled and \n","the boat put about. frodo was just in time to grasp sam by the hair as he \n","came up, bubbling and struggling. fear was staring in his round brown eyes. \n","\n","'up you come, sam my lad! ' said frodo. 'now take my hand! ' \n","\n","'save me, mr. frodo! ' gasped sam. 'i'm drownded. i can't see your \n","hand.' \n","\n","'here it is. don't pinch, lad! i won't let you go. tread water and \n","don't flounder, or you'll upset the boat. there now, get hold of the side, \n","and let me use the paddle! ' \n","\n","with a few strokes frodo brought the boat back to the bank, and sam was \n","able to scramble out, wet as a water-rat. frodo took off the ring and \n","stepped ashore again. \n","\n","'of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, sam! ' he said. \n","\n","'oh, mr. frodo, that's hard! ' said sam shivering. 'that's hard, trying \n","to go without me and all. if i hadn't a guessed right, where would you be \n","now? ' \n","\n","'safely on my way.' \n","\n","'safely! ' said sam. 'all alone and without me to help you? i couldn't \n","have a borne it, it'd have been the death of me.' \n","\n","'it would be the death of you to come with me, sam,' said frodo and i \n","could not have borne that.' \n","\n","'not as certain as being left behind,' said sam. \n","\n","'but i am going to mordor.' \n","\n","'i know that well enough, mr. frodo. of course you are. and i'm coming \n","with you.' \n","\n","'now, sam,' said frodo, 'don't hinder me! the others will be coming \n","back at any minute. if they catch me here. i shall have to argue and \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","explain, and i shall never have the heart or the chance to get off. but i \n","must go at once. it's the only way.' \n","\n","'of course it is,' answered sam. 'but not alone. i'm coming too, or \n","neither of us isn't going. i'll knock holes in all the boats first.' \n","\n","frodo actually laughed. a sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. \n","'leave one! 'he said. 'we'll need it. but you can't come like this without \n","your gear or food or anything.' \n","\n","'just hold on a moment, and i'll get my stuff!' cried sam eagerly. \n","\n","'it's all ready. i thought we should be off today.' he rushed to the camping \n","place, fished out his pack from the pile where frodo had laid it when he \n","emptied the boat of his companions' goods grabbed a spare blanket, and some \n","extra packages of food, and ran back. \n","\n","'so all my plan is spoilt! ' said frodo. 'it is no good trying to \n","escape you. but i'm glad, sam. i cannot tell you how glad. come along! it is \n","plain that we were meant to go together. we will go, and may the others find \n","a safe road! strider will look after them. i don't suppose we shall see them \n","again.' \n","\n","'yet we may, mr frodo. we may,' said sam. \n","\n","so frodo and sam set off on the last stage of the quest together. frodo \n","paddled away from the shore, and the river bore them swiftly away, down the \n","western arm, and past the frowning cliffs of tol brandir. the roar of the \n","great falls drew nearer. even with such help as sam could give, it was hard \n","work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive \n","the boat eastward towards the far shore. \n","\n","at length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of amon \n","lhaw. there they found a shelving shore, and they drew the boat out, high \n","above the water, and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder. \n","\n","then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would \n","bring them over the grey hills of the emyn muil, and down into the land of \n","shadow.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"FFF4ZK1hhCu0","colab_type":"code","outputId":"ffccdbd6-3357-4591-92b9-dcb8b7d4a8e2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1553983620909,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":379,"user":{"displayName":"Zane Durante","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JzHt-ajhyDE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApI/VtAQgSyhEhA/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05159585714773361430"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"cell_type":"code","source":["chars = sorted(list(set(text)))\n","print('total chars:', len(chars))\n","char_indices = dict((c, i) for i, c in enumerate(chars))\n","indices_char = dict((i, c) for i, c in enumerate(chars))"],"execution_count":158,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["total chars: 56\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"W4BjheNADHdp","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import pickle\n","\n","with open(DICT_PATH, 'wb') as f:\n","  pickle.dump(char_indices, f)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"oHzZQqKIhEmD","colab_type":"code","outputId":"fc89eb1e-165d-45ef-94c1-8f1458d0fd5c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1553983623388,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":288,"user":{"displayName":"Zane Durante","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JzHt-ajhyDE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApI/VtAQgSyhEhA/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05159585714773361430"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54}},"cell_type":"code","source":["print(chars)"],"execution_count":160,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["['\\n', ' ', '!', '\"', '&', \"'\", '(', ')', '*', ',', '-', '.', '/', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', ':', ';', '=', '?', '[', '\\\\', '_', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"ymYQJj9IhFmh","colab_type":"code","outputId":"1572f3cf-f414-463f-c160-d4431b7de17e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1553983637053,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1302,"user":{"displayName":"Zane Durante","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JzHt-ajhyDE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApI/VtAQgSyhEhA/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05159585714773361430"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"cell_type":"code","source":["maxlen = 40\n","step = 3\n","sentences = []\n","next_chars = []\n","for i in range(0, len(text) -
