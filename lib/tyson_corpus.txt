almost all armed conflict in the history of the world came about because opposing sides believed different things to be true.
odd that our measures of animal intelligence are often tests for what we do best, rather than tests for what they do best.
in noh-south oriented stadiums, like nrg in houston, eah's rotation deflects a 50-yd field goal to the right by 1/2 inch.
if a football were the sun at the 50-yard line, eah would be at the 15-yard line. pluto, a quaer-mile away. get over it.
just an fyi: a 250 lb football player, running 15 mph, has more kinetic energy than a bullet fired from an ak-47 rifle.

congratulations to @trevornoah tonight. @thedailyshow's new opening credits now show eah rotating in the correct direction.
@dianamoon124 welcome to the twittererse. any and all corrections to my twitter-feed are welcome.

@scottjonesy did all this moon-talk make you think of that question?  for me, it's roquefo.  put price usually sends me down to st. augur.
oops. left out an impoant one:  supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
proper uses of the word super:  superman, supernova, super duper, super bowl, supercharged, superconductivity, super mario.
resist the hype: the size of today's 'super' moon is to next month's full moon as a 16.07 inch pizza is to a 16.00 inch pizza

there's no greater incentive to lie than the threat of punishment for telling the truth.
if your body were bolted to the ground when eah stopped rotating, then your head would snap off, and it would roll due east
i'm just sayin'
if eah stopped rotating, everyone not bolted to the ground would fall over and roll due east at the speed of a jet plane.

@gedeon you've invoked specious statistical reasoning, as detailed in 'the pluto files'.  link to come sholy, if interested
first rule of science: must finish experiment before you die. @newhorizons2015 was launched fast. reached pluto in 9 years.
#plutofacts: as repoed in the @nytimes in 1930, when discovered, pluto was presumed to be the size of eah.
#plutofacts: pluto would fit comfoably between new york &amp; dallas. between rome &amp; moscow.  between peh &amp; melbourne.

#plutofacts: in 1979, pluto crossed neptune's orbit, and for 20 years was the eighth 'planet' in the solar system.
#plutofacts pluto's primary moon charon is so large that their mutual center-of-mass lies not within pluto but in empty space

at the (slow) rate the moon is tidally locking eah, the sun will die before it succeeds ' a more impoant concern for all.
contrary to pink floyd's 1973 album-cover proclamation, there is no dark side of the moon. a day there simply lasts a month.
eah has already tidally locked the moon, which is why it shows only one face to eah - the 'near' side.
the moon's motivation: luna is desperately trying to slow eah's rotation so that one eah day eventually equals one month.

curious fact that those who never fail are also those who never truly succeed.
for algebra geeks: if the thickness of a pizza is a, and its radius is z, and pi is just pi, then its volume is v = pizza.
in other words, if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide, then the next 1-inch band occupies 30% of the topping's area.
if the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust, the pie is missing 30% of the cheese that could be there
a 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food.  nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie.
odd that pizza is sold by the inch, but consumed by the square-inch. this fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings.

want more? the moon's latinized name is luna.  if you are "of the moon' youre simply 'lunar'.  lunatics are something else..
not that anybody asked, but the sun's latinized name is sol.  if you are "of the sun" you are simply 'solar'.
venus is the roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. and so medical doctors assigned venereal - 'of venus' to all related diseases
ceres is the roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops, which indeed gives us our breakfast word cereal --  "of ceres".
gotta give you that one @elakdawalla.  if you're from the dwarf planet ceres, you'd surely be cereal. https://t.co/e5siaycxvd
from venus? then you're venusian. but the proper term is venereal. unfounately doctors nabbed it before astrophysicists did
and it seems to me that any life forms we discover within jupiter's icy moon europa would rightly be called europeans.
seems to me, if we discover any life forms from the vega star system (constellation lyrae) they'd rightly be called vegans.

reminder: never look to me for opinions on new films. all i do is highlight the science one might or might not find in them.
in #interstellar, if you didn't understand the plot, there is no published book to help you.
in #interstellar, if you didn't understand the physics, try kip thorne's highly readable bbook 'the science of interstellar"
in #interstellar: on another planet, around another star, in another pa of the galaxy, two guys get into a fist fight.
in #interstellar: of the leading characters (all of whom are scientists or engineers) half are women. just an fyi.
in #interstellar: they reprise the matched-rotation docking maneuver from "2001: a space odyssey," but they spin 100x faster.
in #interstellar: you enter a 3-dimensional poal in space. yes, you can fall in from any direction. yes, it's a worm hole.
in #interstellar: you observe great tidal waves from great tidal forces, of magnitude that orbiting a black hole might create
in #interstellar: the producers knew exactly how, why, &amp; when you'd achieve zero-g in space.
relativity. gravity. quantum. electrodynamics. evolution. each of these theories is true, whether or not you believe in them.
in #interstellar: experience einstein's curvature of space as no other feature film has shown.
in #interstellar: experience einstein's relativity of time as no other feature film has shown.
gps satellites are pre-corrected for general relativity, allowing them to beam us the accurate time for eah's surface.
gps satellites, located faher from eah's center than we are, keep faster time than do our clocks on eah's surface.
in #interstellar: and in the real universe, strong gravitational fields measurably slow passage of time relative to others.
in #interstellar: there's a robot named kipp. one of the executive producers, a physicist, is named kip. i'm just saying.
in #interstellar: all leading characters, including mcconaughey, hathaway, chastain, &amp; caine play a scientist or engineer.

got a bunch more southern hemisphere tidbits, but i think i'll save them for even later...
so 'alpha" centauri is the brightest star in the constellation centaurus. and 'beta" pictoris is the 2nd brightest in pictor.
apa from common names, stars are generally id'ed in order of brightness within a constellation, using the greek alphabet.
the southern skies have the closest star system to the sun - the famed 'alpha centauri'  the 3rd brightest in the night sky.
eah is closest to the sun during the southern hemisphere summer. for the noh, that of course coincides with our winter.
many big telescope in the noh have twins in the south, giving astrophysicists coherent full-sky coverage of the universe.
just an fyi: eah's south magnetic pole is actually in the noh. that's why the noh tip of a compass needle points there.
the center of the milky way ' a target of study for my phd ' passes directly overhead for all middle southern latitudes.
'arctic" derives from arktos, the greek word for bear. the arctic's got em. (for now.) the ant-arctic doesn't.
what's the noh pole? curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of rotation. stick out your thumb. that's noh.

@hernaez i trust you will still be awake in six hours.  -ntyson
hmm. i think i'll take a break for 6 or 7 hours ' until the aussies wake up ' then continue the southern hemisphere hijinks.
@stompn_tom: last i checked pittsburgh is in the nohern hemisphere &amp; has many free penguins. // human penguins don't count.
sundials designed for the noh won't work in the southern hemisphere. if poed there, they would reckon time backwards.
in the noh, the shadow of a sundial's gnomon sweeps clockwise. that's, in fact, what defined clockwise in the first place.
some of us in the noh are jealous that 100% of the world's population of free penguins live in the southern hemisphere.
@arrowsails yes.
eah is not only oblate ' wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped ' slightly wider just south of the equator
eah's centrifugal force at the equator renders everybody and everything about 6% lighter than they'd weigh at the poles.
at a revolution speed of 1,700 km / hour, the equator is eah's fastest moving pa. all other latitudes move more slowly.
i think it's cool that there's a country on the equator with the name "equator". better known in spanish as ecuador
antarctica's subglacial lake vostok is a body of water, trapped in ice, that hasn't seen air in at least 15-million years.
the flag in antarctica that id's the south pole has to be repositioned  every year. the glacier beneath moves continuously.
the south pole is covered with land: antarctica. in the noh, santa's gotta live on an (ever-shrinking) slab of floating ice
at about 2800 meters above sea level, the south pole plateau sits at an elevation almost as high as that of mount olympus.
toilet bowls drain however they're designed to circulate water.  it's irrelevant whether you live above or below the equator.

at #amillionways pay in santa fe, i re-met @kaleycuoco from @bigbang_cbs. friend of @sethmacfarlane http://t.co/hoe6bdphnq
at #amillionways pay in santa fe, nm #cosmos was invited, along with some friends of @sethmacfarlane http://t.co/xesk3oauz1
trivia: #amillionways filmed near santa fe, new mexico at the same time as #cosmos, enabling @sethmacfarlane to visit our set
the film #amillionways to die in the west would be numerically accurate if named a million occasions to utter the word f%&amp;k
apa from a badly oriented full moon, i give #amillionways an 'a' for its sweeping &amp; romantic porayals of the night sky.
was ready to count up to 1,000,000.  but #amillionways sho-changed me. it showed only twenty-two ways to die in the west.
the block of ice porayed in #amillionways would weigh about 2.5 tons. enough to squash pretty much anything it fell on.

if the charlotte motor speedway increased their banking angle from 24 to 31 degrees, the cars could do the turn at 200 mph.
if you travel faster than 165 mph on the 24-degree bank turns at charlotte motor speedway you will skid into the embankment.

lunar eclipses are visible from the entire eah hemisphere facing the moon. that's billions &amp; billions of people  : - )
those who don't know a lunar eclipse is in progress will likely mistake eah's shadow for the moon going through phases.
at 3.5 hrs, total lunar eclipses are long &amp; boring. wait for the moon to enter the deepest pa of eah's shadow: 1:58am et.
total eclipses occur every couple of years or so. if anyone calls them "rare", ask if they feel that way about the olympics.
dust in eah's atmosphere can tint sunlight, casting eclipsed moons in a deep red light. but often the moon just gets dark.
after midnight monday et, the full moon ambles deep into eah's projected shadow in space: behold a total lunar eclipse.

no, seasons do not come from eah's orbit, but whether your hemisphere's pole is tipping toward or away from the sun.

supersonic planes can fly east-west fast enough to reverse sunsets, landing at a clock time earlier than when they took off.
planes fly between 500 &amp; 650 mph, so east-west sunset flights don't freeze the sun, but they beautifully prolong twilight.

that was three-weeks-woh of tweets in one evening. sorry to overload your twitter streams. good night universe.
thought experiment: stand on a scale in an elevator. cut the cable. you, the scale, and the elevator fall -- scale reads zero
cool experiment: poke a hole anywhere in a paper cup of water. drop cup. water, while weightless in free fall, stops spewing.
mysteries of #gravity: astronaut clooney informs medical doctor bullock what happens medically during oxygen deprivation.
an orbit is a continual state of free fall, but while moving so fast sideways that the surface curves away at the same rate.
fall towards eah. fall towards the moon. fall towards mars. fall towards anywhere at all, you'll be weightless in zero-g
eah's gravity extends to infinity. to experience "zero-g" simply requires you move through space without rockets firing.
my tweets hardly ever convey opinion. mostly perspectives on the world. but if you must know, i enjoyed #gravity very much.
fyi: angular momentum -- the tendency, once set rotating, to keep rotating, unless another force acts to slow or stop it.
mysteries of #gravity: why we enjoy a scifi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space
mysteries of #gravity: satellite communications were disrupted at 230 mi up, but communications satellites orbit 100x higher.
mysteries of #gravity: nearly all satellites orbit eah west to east yet all satellite debris porayed orbited east to west
mysteries of #gravity: why bullock's hair, in otherwise convincing zero-g scenes, did not float freely on her head.
mysteries of #gravity: why anyone is impressed with a zero-g film 45 years after being impressed with "2001:a space odyssey"
mysteries of #gravity: when clooney releases bullock's tether, he drifts away. in zero-g a single tug brings them together.
mysteries of #gravity: how hubble (350mi up) iss (230mi up) &amp; a chinese space station are all in sight lines of one another.
mysteries of #gravity:  why bullock, a medical doctor, is servicing the hubble space telescope.
the film #gravity depicts a scenario of catastrophic satellite destruction that can actually happen.
the film #gravity should be renamed "angular momentum"
the film #gravity should be renamed "zero gravity"
11:39am et: just logged 32,123,221,000.54 miles around the sun. divide by eah's orbital circumference (2*pi*1au) you get 55

are you a tide weenie? i wrote an essay called "the tidal force" some years ago:  [2,000 words] http://t.co/evuodtrfcu
not only is eah's rotation slowly slowing down, but the moon's orbit is spiraling away from us by about 2-inches per year.
and not to disturb anybody, but tides cause friction between eah's crust and the sloshing oceans, slowing down our rotation
the sun's tides are only about 1/3 that of the moon's, so even during the canceling quaer phases, some moon-tide remains.
during half-moons (1st &amp; 3rd quaer), the lunar &amp; solar tides add out of phase, paly canceling one another.
the tides during full (and new) moon are highest **only** because that's when the sun's tides add directly to them.
while we're on the subject: the moon's capacity to raise tides on eah is no greater when full than at any other phase.
submitted without fuher comment. http://t.co/dx9rrqplse
fyi:moon's orbit around eah is oval. distance varies by about 10%. when moon is full &amp; "close", some call it the super moon
the perennially hyped name "super moon" insults the legacy of superman, super volcanoes, supernovae, and even super mario.
okay to call tonight's full moon "super", but only if you would call a 13-inch pizza "super" compared with a 12-inch pizza.

security is knowing that you've out-witted or out-maneuvered all that can harm you. asteroids are not yet on this list.

politicians lie not because they're evil, but because they say what voters want to hear. so it's we who are the problem.
an atheist, an agnostic, and a fundamentalist walk into a bar. one then says to the others,"we should duck next time."
.@samcornwell: looked at the moon. it's not blue. // the list of blue things does not include moons, but does include smurfs.
a month's second full moon is the blue moon. not rare. more frequent than presidential elections, yet nobody calls them rare.
the first crewed spacecraft to mars should be named the "armstrong". that works on so many levels.
neil a. armstrong 1930-2012. farewell my friend. and now, perhaps more than ever, i bid you godspeed.
@nasawatch: um, you did see the pioneer &amp; voyager plaques, right? // those would be "robotic" exploration. i do choose my words carefully.
apollo 11, july 1969.  no other act of human exploration ever laid a plaque saying "we come in peace for all mankind"
"men walk on moon" - the only positive event in the last 50 yrs for which everyone remembers where they were when it happened
neil armstrong was the spiritual repository of spacefaring dreams &amp; ambitions. in death, a little bit of us all dies with him

if aliens did visit us, i'd be embarrassed to tell them we still dig up fossil fuels from the ground as a source of energy.
it seems that we're better at finding someone to blame for our problems than we are at finding creative solutions to fix them
.@shonkly: think we'll ever be able to reverse entropy? // yup. add energy, like sunlight, &amp; it's inevitable: life on eah.
.@wylieam: is there an upper limit for temperature? // nope. just keep adding heat. take away all heat to reach absolute zero

if the west coast had settled before the east coast then cities like chicago in the mid-west would instead be the middle-east
@benmilligan  "uranus crunch - nori maki" an actual uranus snack? thanks. but i can't actually find it anywhere.
