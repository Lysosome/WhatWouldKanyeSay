Almost all armed conflict in the history of the world came about because opposing sides believed different things to be true.
Odd that our measures of animal intelligence are often tests for what we do best, rather than tests for what they do best.
In North-South oriented stadiums, like NRG in Houston, Earth’s rotation deflects a 50-yd field goal to the right by 1/2 inch.
if a football were the Sun at the 50-yard line, Earth would be at the 15-yard line. Pluto, a quarter-mile away. Get over it.
Just an FYI: A 250 lb football player, running 15 mph, has more kinetic energy than a bullet fired from an AK-47 rifle.
In a perfect spiral with high arc, aerodynamics forces a football to angle upward on the way up &amp; downward on the way down.

Most people can take or leave Indigo as a Rainbow color, but Newton was mystically fascinated with 7, so we’re stuck with it.

Isaac Newton, in Opticks (1704), published his discovery that white light is composed of colors - the colors in Rainbows.
A Rainbow forms only broadside to your line of sight. That's why the pot of Gold at its base remains eternally out of reach.

Astro-folk invented time-keeping. So for #SB50, Coldplay must sing “Clocks”.
FYI: Roman Numerals have no Zero. Invented after the Empire, which is why the traditional Christian calendar has no year Zero
A triumph of Arabic numerals:  After forty-nine Super Bowls enumerated by Roman Numerals, we hashtag #SB50 and not #SBL

The Cosmos is knowable. When childhood curiosity persists as an adult, it inoculates against others telling you what to think
@bobatl Duude — to be clear: Being five centuries regressed in your reasoning doesn’t mean we all can’t still like your music
@bobatl Flat Earth is a problem only when people in charge think that way. No law stops you from regressively basking in it.
@bobatl Polaris is gone by 1.5 deg S. Latitude. You’ve never been south of Earth’s Equator, or if so, you've never looked up.

Male &amp; female Reindeer grow antlers, but males lose them in winter. All Santa’s reindeer, Rudolph too, are therefore female.
If people left carrots, celery, &amp; hot tea for Santa on the table rather than milk &amp; cookies, I bet he’d be much, much thinner
Never understood why an overweight Arctic toymaker delivers Christmas gifts rather than representations of the Three Wise Men
Santa is pale because he’s in the middle of six months of darkness on Earth’s North Pole. And he delivers gifts only at night
As Earth warms, and Arctic ice melts, Santa will lose his habitat too. Soon we’ll see photos of him clutched to an ice floe.
Since the Northern Arctic is just ocean, Santa’s North Pole workshop has only ever existed on a floating sheet of ice.

With next year’s @SuperBowl 50 the NFL abandons Roman Numerals, leaving @StarWars as the last bastion of this counting system
Both at age 19, my wife saw @StarWars in 1977 &amp; our daughter saw #TheForceAwakens in 2015. I don’t know what that means.
( A Parsec is an obscure unit of distance in Astrophysics, equal to 3.26 Light Years. Neither has anything to do with time. )
Unashamed of inanity, #TheForceAwakens repeats the Millennium Falcon boast of completing the Kessel Run in "under 12 parsecs"
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the starry skies were unfamiliar. As they should be, a long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, apparently Wookiees don’t age, or they age much slower than human actors do.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the Storm Troopers still run as though they’re carrying a full load of poop in their diapers.
Never seen Romanescu Broccoli?  Fractal Earth food befitting a tale of long ago and far, far away. https://t.co/NZDkWpeqOB
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the lead character snacks on what includes Romanescu Broccoli, nature’s only fractal food.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, once again I felt isolated and inadequate for not understanding Wookiee-speak.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the energy in a Star is enough to destroy ten-thousand planets, not just a few here &amp; there.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, if you were to suck all of a star’s energy into your planet, your planet would vaporize.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens the TIE fighters made exactly the same sound in the vacuum of space as in planetary atmospheres
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8, a smooth rolling metal spherical ball, would have skidded uncontrollably on sand.
I guess I did just demote R2D2 to “Dwarf Cute” status.  No hard feelings though.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8 is waaaaay cuter than R2D2.

At the (slow) rate the Moon is tidally locking Earth, the Sun will die before it succeeds — a more important concern for all.
Contrary to Pink Floyd's 1973 album-cover proclamation, there is no Dark Side of the Moon. A day there simply lasts a month.
Earth has already tidally locked the Moon, which is why it shows only one face to Earth - the “near” side.
The Moon’s Motivation: Luna is desperately trying to slow Earth’s rotation so that one Earth day eventually equals one Month.

June 30th's leap second will manifest as an extra second in the last minute of the day, Greenwich time. ( 7h 59m 60s  PM  ET)

Curious fact that those who never fail are also those who never truly succeed.
For Algebra Geeks: If the thickness of a pizza is A, and its radius is Z, and pi is just PI, then its volume is V = PIZZA.
In other words, if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide, then the next 1-inch band occupies 30% of the topping's area.
If the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust, the pie is missing 30% of the cheese that could be there
A 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food.  Nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie.
Odd that pizza is sold by the inch, but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings.

Not that anybody asked, but the Sun's Latinized name is Sol.  If you are "of the Sun" you are simply “Solar”.
Venus is the Roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. And so medical doctors assigned Venereal - “of Venus” to all related diseases
Ceres is the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops, which indeed gives us our breakfast word Cereal --  "of Ceres".

Meteors meet fiery deaths as they plunge through Earth’s atmosphere. So the term “Meteoric Rise” makes no sense whatsoever.

Fifty-four years ago, Yuri Gagarin is launched into orbit by the Soviets. He is the 4th mammal species to achieve this feat.

You’re curious -- I can feel it. How many digits of Pi before the numerals 0123456789 appear in sequence? 17,387,594,879
I’m all Pi’ed out.  But okay, one more…
Yup. I’ve been Pi-Lingual since childhood. I want to be ready. May need it in a first exchange of greetings with Space Aliens

A year ago, I interviewed @TheTweetOfGod for @StarTalkRadio, and he explained Pi. [at t = 14m 35s] http://t.co/Ni1hrvD0Xs
The Bible’s best estimate for Pi:  3.0  (1 Kings 7:23)
The “P” sound in the Greek letter Pi evokes “periphery”.  Multiply any circle's diameter by Pi and you get its circumference.
Get your Geek on. Time to fit all the digits of Pi into a single tweet:  Pi in base Pi = 10
My next tweet will contain every single digit of Pi...

In #Interstellar: You enter a 3-Dimensional portal in space. Yes, you can fall in from any direction. Yes, it’s a Worm Hole.
In #Interstellar: You observe great Tidal Waves from great Tidal Forces, of magnitude that orbiting a Black Hole might create
In #Interstellar: The producers knew exactly how, why, &amp; when you’d achieve zero-G in space.
Relativity. Gravity. Quantum. Electrodynamics. Evolution. Each of these theories is true, whether or not you believe in them.
In #Interstellar: Experience Einstein's Curvature of Space as no other feature film has shown.

GPS Satellites are pre-corrected for General Relativity, allowing them to beam us the accurate time for Earth’s surface.
GPS satellites, located farther from Earth’s center than we are, keep faster time than do our clocks on Earth’s surface.
In #Interstellar: And in the real universe, strong gravitational fields measurably slow passage of time relative to others.
In #Interstellar: There’s a robot named KIPP. One of the Executive Producers, a physicist, is named Kip. I’m just saying.
In #Interstellar: All leading characters, including McConaughey, Hathaway, Chastain, &amp; Caine play a scientist or engineer.

Got a bunch more Southern Hemisphere tidbits, but I think I’ll save them for even later...
So “Alpha" Centauri is the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus. And “Beta" Pictoris is the 2nd brightest in Pictor.
Apart from common names, stars are generally ID'ed in order of brightness within a constellation, using the Greek alphabet.
The Southern skies have the closest star system to the Sun - the famed “Alpha Centauri”  The 3rd brightest in the night sky.
Earth is closest to the Sun during the Southern Hemisphere Summer. For the North, that of course coincides with our winter.
Many big telescope in the North have twins in the South, giving astrophysicists coherent full-sky coverage of the Universe.
Just an FYI: Earth’s South Magnetic Pole is actually in the North. That’s why the North tip of a compass needle points there.
The center of the Milky Way — a target of study for my PhD — passes directly overhead for all middle southern latitudes.
“Arctic" derives from Arktos, the Greek word for Bear. The Arctic's got em. (For now.) The Ant-Arctic doesn't.
What’s the North Pole? Curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of rotation. Stick out your thumb. That’s North.

@Stompn_Tom: Last I checked Pittsburgh is in the Northern Hemisphere &amp; has many free Penguins. // Human Penguins don’t count.
Sundials designed for the North won't work in the Southern Hemisphere. If ported there, they would reckon time backwards.
In the North, the shadow of a sundial’s gnomon sweeps clockwise. That’s, in fact, what defined clockwise in the first place.
Some of us in the North are jealous that 100% of the world’s population of free Penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere.
@arrowsails Yes.
Earth is not only oblate — wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped — slightly wider just south of the equator
Earth's centrifugal force at the Equator renders everybody and everything about 6% lighter than they’d weigh at the poles.
At a revolution speed of 1,700 km / hour, the equator is Earth’s fastest moving part. All other latitudes move more slowly.
I think it's cool that there's a country on the equator with the name "Equator". Better known in Spanish as Ecuador
Antarctica’s subglacial Lake Vostok is a body of water, trapped in ice, that hasn’t seen air in at least 15-million years.
The flag in Antarctica that ID's the South Pole has to be repositioned  every year. The glacier beneath moves continuously.
The South Pole is covered with land: Antarctica. In the North, Santa’s gotta live on an (ever-shrinking) slab of floating ice
At about 2800 meters above sea level, the South Pole plateau sits at an elevation almost as high as that of Mount Olympus.
Toilet Bowls drain however they're designed to circulate water.  It’s irrelevant whether you live above or below the equator.

At #AMillionWays party in Santa Fe, NM #Cosmos was invited, along with some friends of @SethMacFarlane http://t.co/XesK3OaUz1
Trivia: #AMillionWays filmed near Santa Fe, New Mexico at the same time as #Cosmos, enabling @SethMacFarlane to visit our set
The film #AMillionWays to Die in the West would be numerically accurate if named A Million Occasions to Utter the Word F%&amp;K
Apart from a badly oriented full moon, I give #AMillionWays an “A” for its sweeping &amp; romantic portrayals of the night sky.
Was ready to count up to 1,000,000.  But #AMillionWays short-changed me. It showed only twenty-two ways to die in the west.
The block of ice portrayed in #AMillionWays would weigh about 2.5 tons. Enough to squash pretty much anything it fell on.

If the Charlotte Motor Speedway increased their banking angle from 24 to 31 degrees, the cars could do the turn at 200 mph.

At 3.5 hrs, Total Lunar Eclipses are long &amp; boring. Wait for the Moon to enter the deepest part of Earth's shadow: 1:58am ET.
Total Eclipses occur every couple of years or so. If anyone calls them "rare", ask if they feel that way about the Olympics.
Dust in Earth's atmosphere can tint sunlight, casting eclipsed Moons in a deep red light. But often the Moon just gets dark.

You can’t compress ice. If you try, it instantly liquefies to occupy less volume, as under the hi-pressure of a skate blade.
As anybody who freezes food knows, water becoming ice expands by about 10%. Also why 10% of an iceberg sits above the water.

Supersonic planes can fly east-west fast enough to reverse Sunsets, landing at a clock time earlier than when they took off.
Planes fly between 500 &amp; 650 mph, so east-west sunset flights don't freeze the Sun, but they beautifully prolong twilight.

Thought Experiment: Stand on a scale in an elevator. Cut the cable. You, the scale, and the elevator fall -- scale reads zero
Cool Experiment: Poke a hole anywhere in a paper cup of water. Drop cup. Water, while weightless in free fall, stops spewing.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Astronaut Clooney informs medical doctor Bullock what happens medically during oxygen deprivation.
An Orbit is a continual state of free fall, but while moving so fast sideways that the surface curves away at the same rate.
Fall towards Earth. Fall towards the Moon. Fall towards Mars. Fall towards anywhere at all, you'll be weightless in zero-G
Earth's gravity extends to infinity. To experience "zero-G" simply requires you move through space without rockets firing.
My Tweets hardly ever convey opinion. Mostly perspectives on the world. But if you must know, I enjoyed #Gravity very much.
FYI: Angular Momentum -- The tendency, once set rotating, to keep rotating, unless another force acts to slow or stop it.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why we enjoy a SciFi film set in make-believe space more than we enjoy actual people set in real space
Mysteries of #Gravity: Satellite communications were disrupted at 230 mi up, but communications satellites orbit 100x higher.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Nearly all satellites orbit Earth west to east yet all satellite debris portrayed orbited east to west
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why Bullock's hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why anyone is impressed with a zero-G film 45 years after being impressed with "2001:A Space Odyssey"
Mysteries of #Gravity: When Clooney releases Bullock's tether, he drifts away. In zero-G a single tug brings them together.
Mysteries of #Gravity: How Hubble (350mi up) ISS (230mi up) &amp; a Chinese Space Station are all in sight lines of one another.
Mysteries of #Gravity:  Why Bullock, a medical Doctor, is servicing the Hubble Space Telescope.
The film #Gravity depicts a scenario of catastrophic satellite destruction that can actually happen.

And not to disturb anybody, but Tides cause friction between Earth's crust and the sloshing oceans, slowing down our rotation
The Sun's tides are only about 1/3 that of the Moon's, so even during the canceling quarter phases, some Moon-tide remains.
During half-moons (1st &amp; 3rd quarter), the Lunar &amp; Solar tides add out of phase, partly canceling one another.
The tides during Full (and New) Moon are highest **only** because that's when the Sun's tides add directly to them.
While we're on the subject: The Moon's capacity to raise tides on Earth is no greater when Full than at any other phase.
Submitted without further comment. http://t.co/dX9rRQPLsE
FYI:Moon's orbit around Earth is oval. Distance varies by about 10%. When Moon is Full &amp; "close", some call it the Super Moon
The perennially hyped name "Super Moon" insults the legacy of Superman, Super Volcanoes, Supernovae, and even Super Mario.
Okay to call tonight's Full Moon "super", but only if you would call a 13-inch pizza "super" compared with a 12-inch pizza.

.@benpopik: Does the Sun set in the same spot all the time? // No. Only for the equator people, where it sets due-west daily.

The Big Bang Theory sitcom is so successful, if you Google “Big Bang Theory” It precedes the actual creation of the Universe.

Politicians lie not because they're evil, but because they say what voters want to hear. So it's we who are the problem.
An atheist, an agnostic, and a fundamentalist walk into a bar. One then says to the others,"We should duck next time."
.@Samcornwell: Looked at the Moon. It's not blue. // The list of blue things does not include Moons, but does include Smurfs.
A month's second full Moon is the Blue Moon. Not rare. More frequent than Presidential elections, yet nobody calls them rare.
The first crewed spacecraft to Mars should be named the "Armstrong". That works on so many levels.
Neil A. Armstrong 1930-2012. Farewell my friend. And now, perhaps more than ever, I bid you godspeed.
@NASAWatch: Um, you did see the Pioneer &amp; Voyager plaques, right? // Those would be "robotic" exploration. I do choose my words carefully.
Apollo 11, July 1969.  No other act of human exploration ever laid a plaque saying "We Come In Peace For All Mankind"
"Men Walk On Moon" - The only positive event in the last 50 yrs for which everyone remembers where they were when it happened
Neil Armstrong was the spiritual repository of spacefaring dreams &amp; ambitions. In death, a little bit of us all dies with him
Ausgust 24, 2012: The 5th anniversary of Pluto's "Dwarf Planet" reclassification. May the little fella RIP (Revolve in Peace)
If aliens did visit us, I'd be embarrassed to tell them we still dig up fossil fuels from the ground as a source of energy.
It seems that we're better at finding someone to blame for our problems than we are at finding creative solutions to fix them
.@Shonkly: Think we'll ever be able to reverse entropy? // Yup. Add energy, like sunlight, &amp; it's inevitable: Life on Earth.
.@wylieam: Is there an upper limit for temperature? // Nope. Just keep adding heat. Take away all heat to reach Absolute Zero
Hidden cannibalistic urges? Words of affection referencing sweet food: honey, cupcake, pumpkin, cutie pie, sugar, eye candy.
@B_Wight Looks like slag, a byproduct of smelting metal ore.  Meteorites are typcially smooth and without pits.

Scaled by GDP (USA: 15-Trillion; JAM: 15-Billion) Jamaica is the undisputed champion of sports in the history of the Universe
Scaled by population (5-medal min) the 5 most under-achieving countries in 2012 #Olympics 1) IND 2) MEX 3) CHN 4) TUR 5) ETH
Scaled by population (9-medal min), the top-5 winning countries in the 2012 #Olympics were 1) JAM 2) NZL 3) HUN 4) DEN 5) AUS
In the 2012 #Olympics, USA won 104, China 88 medals. If China had the population of the USA, they'd have won only 20 medals.
In the 2012 #Olympics, USA won 104, Jamaica 12 medals. If Jamaica had the population of the USA, they'd have won 1382 medals.

.@ELTav0Tav0: How fast are potentially devastating asteroids? // The poky ones will hit us going about 25,000 miles per hour.
Meteor Shower this weekend. After midnight, expect a shooting star per minute in the NE skies. Be there: http://t.co/EHOgREoq
If the West Coast had settled before the East Coast then cities like Chicago in the Mid-West would instead be the Middle-East
@benmilligan  "Uranus Crunch - Nori Maki" An actual Uranus snack? Thanks. But I can't actually find it anywhere.
Tasty Cosmos: Milky Way bar, MoonPie, Eclipse gum, Orbit gum, Sunkist, Celestial Seasonings, Mars bar. No food named Uranus.
Enough on Mars. Must get back to making Earth hotter, cutting science budgets &amp; killing each other over religious differences
@McDonalds: We love this picture! Mind if we retweet it? // You've earned it, I think.

.@b97: Is Mississippi red mud is the same as the red dirt on Mars? // They're both red for the same reason -- oxidized iron.

The day we stop exploring is the day we commit ourselves to live in a stagnant world, devoid of curiosity, empty of dreams.
Once again, I am compelled to tweet…
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Neil deGrasse Tyson signing out on Earth. Back to work - for us both. Closing my Twitterverse wormhole to Mars.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, As for your complicated landing on Mars Sunday night 10:30pm PT -- do not try, do.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, We've got the #Olympics back here on Earth. But many of us will be focussed on you and your landing. Do us proud.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, What are your instructions if a Martian crawls onto your back and rides you like a Rodeo Bull?
