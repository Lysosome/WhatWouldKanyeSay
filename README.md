# WhatWouldKanyeSay

WhatWouldKanyeSay is a web application that generates celebrity speech using deep learning.  
You can choose a celebrity and then type in what you'd like for them to talk about.

Our raw models are saved in /models/, but the code used to create them can be found in /bin/colab/.
(Note that these were created using Google Colab, a free online iPython notebook editor that lets
you use Google GPUs and TPUs for your computation).  To run our website, you should have flask installed.
All of our frontend and backend code can be found in /web/.

"Now not the beauty and the angel, all things are still and sounded around.  
It's in the shadow of the sun and the angel of the sea," -- Generated from Edgar Allen Poe
